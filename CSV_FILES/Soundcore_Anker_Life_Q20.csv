R350RH0BWMBO33,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Want ANC Headphones with $$$ sound but under $60? These deliver that & more IMHO UPDATE Dec 2023,Carolina,5,"Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019! Ankar is truly hard to beat. Just in case you’re looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause. On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy & Anker’s reputation for quality.I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results. They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price. He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn’t pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones. 2) the headband could use a slight redesign. Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled so I have to adjust them & keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about. Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound. I like a variety of music & I hear good bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I’ve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones. That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE: if you’ve read my review you know I’ve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it’s Nov 29 2023. I thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight. The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I’d loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn’t buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on. These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I’m jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I’m thrilled for Anker’s dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn’t sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance. When I’m looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I’ve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2020",AFSQEHFGI4GKAV6ZLXDEBCO5FQPQ,True,374,Color: Black
R1BQMJJBRP2JKK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation for and unbeatable price,Ollie,5,"I have never owned a high-end Bose or Sony noise cancellation headphone so understand the context of my experience.My use case is commuting on Amtrak while also using those hours to work, and at home, drowning out outside music and neighbors loudly chatting. This Q20 performs perfectly for my needs. All the background noise on the train is barely audible and the sound quality of music and lectures is perfect as far as I'm concerned. One weakness is that voices are still relatively clear due to background noise being muted.In comparison to the Beats Studio Pro which I previously used and costs 3x as much, the Q20 is superior in sound quality, noise cancellation and comfort. The Q20 also presses evenly around the ear while the Beat Studio Pro exerts more pressure on the lower end of the headphone and presses harshly against the jaw while less on the upper end. Very uncomfortable at least for me. Q20 is the entry level and with an entry level price but outstanding performance. I've wondered if I should have purchased the Q30 or 45 but considering the comparison with Beats, I'm extremely happy with the Q20. Per some of the other reviews regarding build quality, I do handle mine gently though.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AHGYTRNPF27FJ5DP2NZIJQEFBU7Q,True,10,Color: Black
RMO3BYL4R5F6X,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good budget headphones,Justin,4,"I bought these because I wanted a cheap (inexpensive) set of headphones for the gym to replace my AirPods Pro. I was getting tired of fiddling around with the silicone wing attachments for the AirPods.The quality of these Q20’s seems pretty decent and they are comfortable, though I haven’t worn them for an extended period of time.The sound quality isn’t as great as what you would expect from a more expensive set of headphones, but that was to be expected and they sound pretty good for the price.Noise cancellation in general is pretty weird to me, so I’m not sure how good or bad it is in these Q20’s when it works, but I wasn’t impressed. When I tested it sitting in my room, it did a decent job at drowning out the ambient noise like the hum of my fan, etc. I did notice that ANC does reduce the volume a bit.However, at the gym I felt like the ANC was struggling to work properly. While I was on the stationary bike, it kept alternating between drowning out the ambient noise and letting it through. It sounded as if I was lifting one of the ear cups and then setting it back over my ear repeatedly. Didn’t notice it too much after that, but not sure if I just got used to it.The bass boost feature does add a little more thump to your music but sacrifices audio clarity, so I definitely wouldn’t use it.Overall, these are a decent pair of headphones for $40, audio quality is good, ANC is alright, and they are comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AHJQELHY4ARFZHT5HDCBSP3UVGQQ,True,12,Color: Black
R38XUNRK6U9DLP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent product with good sound quality and noise cancel and battery life but with just one flaw,Fani,5,"This is a fantastic product. I bought it because I wanted something for my flight overseas to reduce the plane hum noise which drastically reduces jet lag.So I bought this and I was amazed how great it wasPros:* great construction, feels sturdy* good choice of colors* came with USB charge cable and regular 3.5mm (I think) jack wire so it plugged into all audio out* bluetooth pairs fast and easily* noise cancelation is excellent* sound quality overall is just amazing* the thing goes over your ears nicely without hurting your ears or making it feel like it's on fire after an hour. It has soft padding and cushioned so it really helps* you feel the whoosh -> reduced sound as soon as you put it over your ear and it auto-enables noise cancel when you power it on which is great and tells you ""Battery high"" etc. which is great* battery life is amazing. Charged it once for like 2-3hours to max and it worked for 15hr flight to and another 15hr flight back and it still said Battery high. I didn't use it all the time. Maybe for like 60-70% of the time which is still great* colors are nice and make it look classy.* it doesn't cause any issues with the band over the head* you can use it wired without needing to power it on so it uses extremely little battery* the controls are fine and the ear muffs are labeled R and L which is a nice touch* haven't tested bluetooth range but I figure it is maybe standard of working across a large room* price is very good for the performance. Sure it is not a Bose ($350+) or JVC ($200+) or some others but for $40-$50 this is truly fantastic.Cons:* the one and only con I found is if you plug in the audio jack the noise cancelation turns off immediately which is a shame. So on the plane I was watching a movie where the audio came in nicely but I could hear the little plane hum as well (it was muted but not noise canceled).Other:* didn't test the bass boost but I'm sure it is great.Overall, I liked it so much I bought 2 of them. My teenage son loved it too and he said they're really great quality and works well. The next gen opinion is important because typically they will be the supporters of such products en masse","Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2024",AGN7WYC5J3DFR3QSD2KSZXPLJLGA,True,132,Color: Black
R15YTZVPTWKV6S,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best budget friendly gym headphones,Landon,5,"I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice. It delivers superb sound, effective noise cancellation, and great comfort, all at an affordable price point.

RHOPBCTZD9LDU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable Price:Performance!,Joel,5,"I've had the Soundcore Q20 headphones for almost a month now, and I thought I'd start off my review with one simple statement: I've only charged these things ONCE since I've taken them out of the box. These headphones have absolutely phenomenal battery life. The only reason I charged them was because I wanted to test how long they would last on a full charge (within my day to day use). I received these headphones on the 1st of April. It is currently the 27th of April and the battery is still at ""Medium"" (there is no visual indicator, however there is a voice that tells you whether your battery is ""High"", ""Medium"", or ""Low"").That being said, I'll go ahead and list some Pros:- Battery Life (Seriously, I can't stress enough how good it is)- Sound Quality- Comfort- Looks- Sturdiness/Build Quality- Noise Cancellation (there's a caveat here, continue reading to see what I mean)BATTERY LIFE:As if I haven't already said enough, these headphones refuse to die. I've used them from anywhere between an hour to 3-4 hours at a time (long gaming sessions or binging a show on my laptop or phone), and they just don't let up. Like I mentioned in the intro, it's been almost an entire month with these headphones and I've only had to charge them once. It is worth mentioning that the battery will drain much faster with noise-cancelling turned on, as it is indeed ACTIVE noise-cancelling and uses more power. I've got to give props to Anker for marketing these as lasting 40 hours, as this runtime is more accurate when noise-cancelling is ON. With ANC off, these can easily last 60+ hours. It's always refreshing to see a company slightly under-sell and over-deliver.SOUND QUALITY:These things sound way better than they should at this price-point. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have experience with over-ear, closed-back studio headphones (I own a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's), and dabble in amateur sound mixing/mastering as a guitarist. Apart from being just a bit heavier on the bass than I would like, these headphones do an excellent job at bringing out lows, mids, and highs in pretty much anything you'll find yourself listening to. Nothing sounds drowned out or overexposed (with the exception of the bass, but there's a valid reason for it in this case). I bought these headphones primarily for multimedia consumption (movies, video games, music, etc.). They have just the right amount of punch in the low-end to make things such as explosions or bass-heavy sound effects really shine. In this instance, the heavier low-end makes sense. Voices sound crystal clear, as the mids don't get drowned out by the lows or highs like on some other higher-priced headphones (looking at you, Beats..). The highs are where these things truly shine, in my opinion. Lots of budget headphones tend to sound very ""tinny"" with harsh, sharp highs to over-compensate for the overly-saturated bass, but these do a great job at keeping both the mids and highs prominent enough (despite the thicker bass).COMFORT:I've owned and used plenty of both over-ear and on-ear headphones over the years, and I can't beat around the bush here: these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I was expecting to have to ""break them in"", given what some of the other reviews were saying, but the minute I put these on I was pleasantly surprised at just how soft and light these felt (without feeling cheap or flimsy). And I wear glasses!LOOKS:Not a whole lot to say about how these look. I wouldn't say you'll be turning heads while wearing these out and about, but for the amount of money that they cost.. I'm just saying they could've looked a lot worse. I've seen headphones three times the price that are a complete eye-sore. The Q20s are clean and minimalistic, without giving away its low price.STURDINESS/BUILD QUALITY:Although I'm not one to man-handle my devices (no matter how little they may cost), I have to say that these don't feel the least bit flimsy. I did a mild stress-test by stretching both ear cups apart as far as I was comfortable with and was able to get about 10 inches wide. I don't think anyone has a head that wide, but if you do, these are definitely going to fit. The build quality feels great, and I feel like these will definitely last a while (and I will be updating this review if that changes lol).NOISE CANCELLATION:These headphones do indeed have active noise cancelling, BUT.. I literally almost NEVER use it. Here's why: they don't need it. The headphones are built in such a way that even with the ANC off, they drown out a ton of outside noise. Unfortunately, there is a significant drop in volume when noise-cancelling is activated. The bass takes a hit as well, making it more evened out with the mids and highs (which might be a plus for some).FINAL THOUGHTS:There's only really one ""Con"" that I wasn't going to mention, and that's the carrying bag that comes with the Q20s. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I did just want to note that they used to come with a hard carrying case (according to some older YouTube reviews), and I'm a little salty that us newer buyers don't get that lol. All in all, for the $60 that I paid for these headphones, I can't think of any reason not to fully recommend them. They sound great, the battery life lasts incredibly long (almost to a suspicious degree, making you feel like today is finally the day it'll need a charge only to be proven wrong), it's got decent looks, solid build, and they even threw in Active Noise Cancellation for situations that call for some extra silence. If you're in the market for some new headphones for multimedia consumption (I definitely would not use these for any professional work, as they are not made for that), and have a bit of a stiffer budget, look no further. These will do more than its price tag leads on.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2023",AG2IY3MWQWDS3BEK37557MIKDP2Q,True,544,Color: Black
R3HQTCIS9L4E3N,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great performance and comfort for transcribing,Krista,5,"I've had these Soundcore Anker LQ20 headphones for a year and have been using them heavily the entire time. They're still going strong and I love them. They're comfortable and the noise cancellation is good. I work from home as a transcriptionist, and I use them for a few hours to several hours a day. They do a good job of blocking or significantly reducing background noises like TV, a noisy AC, lawn mowers, and nearby semi-loud voices. If you use the button to turn off the active noise canceling feature, you'll hear the difference right away.This pair was my first time trying bluetooth headphones for transcribing. I wasn't sure if the sound quality would be as good as wired headphones/good enough for me to accurately transcribe all speech from the audio files I work with, including ones with difficult audio, and I also wondered if there would be any issues with the bluetooth connection being spotty or something. They have worked perfectly and I find them to be very good transcription headphones.I have to charge them fairly often since I use them so much, but I think they have at least average battery life between charges. I usually charge as soon as I notice the voice says ""Battery medium"" at startup because I've learned they'll probably run out in the middle of my work session if I try to wait until it says ""Battery low."" I don't think I've ever even heard ""Battery low.""Great headphones, reasonable price, no complaints.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AGS2HV55N4RN6XK44IT7I5KYHFUA,True,8,Color: Black

Now in 2024 they are starting to break down, it started with band plastic part randomly breaking off. Now the fake leather is starting to peel pretty bad. There are a few factors that could be causing this. 1. I dont store them in the pouch it came with (its my jewelry bag now). 2. I had them hanging on my office desk near my humidifier which i would put essential oils in. And 3 the headphones were in the sun often because my desk was near a window and i live in California.Despite all that this year was the 1st year i used them on an airplane and watched Dune for the 1st time. Noise cancelling was on point, and the sound was beautiful. Besides having pieces of leather on my shirt when taking them off they are still rockin and fit great. Didnt need to charge them the entire trip from California to Africa and back. Well worth the price.

R1REYVNBG5AVBE,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars There are no better BT headphones under $100,Carl Payne,5,"UPDATE: Added the 5th star. Read the review with edits at the end.Wow. I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous. I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers. The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive. The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great. My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year. I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?! Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable. I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great. MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy. After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (""Sacrilege,"" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care. The ""silent note"" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately. The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.So I tested the ANR. I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again. The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys. I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys). THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys. Period. It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere. I mean it. They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR. They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8"" jack.Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies. I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application. If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away. If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.1. The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears. Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight. It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in. If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.2. The battery life isn't that great. To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them. However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without. My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48. Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.3. They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs. This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have. Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).Hope that helps you make a decision. I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.UPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star. The earphone cushions did ""break in,"" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable. Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones. On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine. When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.Battery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically. Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.Finally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC. These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted. I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good. I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.Five stars. When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2022",AGD5QTRAY6ASQKN7OMV3PC6POPSQ,True,1628,Color: Black
R1ABEIBHVJQEA4,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice in budget friendly headphones,Miranda,4,"They're perfect for what I'm using them for-- but definitely read first before buying, because the upgraded version may be what you're looking for.I am incredibly sensitive to headphones (as opposed to earbuds). My head is really sensitive to pressure, and even with light headsets I can start getting a migraine with constant pressure in one spot for too long. My ears also experience the same sensitivity-- they go numb/get tingly pain very easily with on-ear sets.I've been using my Airpod Pros as my go-tos for three years now, but I wanted over-ears for when I'm playing my keyboard piano-- it just gives a better atmospheric sound and nuance, in my opinion. So because of this, it was really important to me to get a pair that could be wired, on top of being bluetooth for versatility. I also prefer a wire option for AIRPLANES! If you ever want to watch an in-flight movie, you still need an aux cable these days. Surprisingly, it was difficult to find a model of headphones that still offer both options. It was a big reason I went with these.CHARGING/BATTERY:The first con is that these use micro USB to charge. Most updated tech is moving to USB-C, and I don't have any other devices that still use micro cables. When I travel with these, I need to remember to bring that designated cord. (Note, the Q20i model has USBC charging) On the other hand, the impressive battery life (60H with ANC off, 40 with it on) does help with that. I also like that it tells you verbally the battery level when you turn them on, so you get a heads up of what the charge is at. However, my apple devices also give me a battery percentage indicator for more accurate levels.EAR CUPS/NOISE CANCELLATION:The over-ear design is so much more comfortable than on-ear, and even helps enhance the active noise cancellation. A lot of external sound is filtered out even with ANC off because of how these cup around your ears snugly (but not too tightly!). My ears fit all the way inside comfortably. As I type this, I have cleaners in my home running a vacuum downstairs and I didn't even notice until I took the headphones off.COMFORT:When I first opened these up and put them on, I felt that the cups were putting slight pressure inward against my head, but after wearing them for ~5hr they seem to have already ""broken in"" and it's not noticeable anymore. As far as the top of the headset, I will say there's not a ton of cushion, but it's enough for these to feel okay for hours on my sensitive head.SIZING:They're not that heavy but they do press down a bit on my head because they're SLIGHTLY large on my head. I'm a 5'4"" woman, I'd say pretty average sized head?? lol - but these do feel a bit big on me. I don't think I would use them for working out or running, something as small as even just looking downward is enough to have them slightly slip. In general I do prefer working out with earbuds anyway just due to sweat, so that's not what I really bought these for anyway but thought I'd mention for any other petite women. Because of this, these are for sure going to be more for piano / computer / travel.BASS/SOUND:I feel like there was mixed reviews about the bass capabilities. Even with the BassUp feature off, I feel like the bass is great on these without distorting! I listen to Billie Eilish a lot, who is known for very bass-heavy music. Without BassUp, her songs sound well balanced (while still obviously bass-heavy). With BassUp on, you get that fuzzy feeling in your ears when the bass kicks in (but still no distortion). Speaking of Billie, she also utilizes stereo sound a lot (some sounds in left ear, some sounds in right) and it sounds great in these. Note that there is no transparency mode on these, but the Q20i model has that if it's a must for you.CONNECTIVITY:This was a big one for me, and probably the reason I am going to be returning these for the upgraded Q20i. I've been spoiled by my Airpods in terms of being able to switch between devices seamlessly (ipad/iphone/imac) without having to disconnect one device and re-pair the other. With this set, I have to go into my iPhone settings, disconnect, then pair with my computer and vice versa whenever I want to switch. It's a small annoyance but a convenience I really prefer.PRICE:I bought these on sale for $39.99 and I feel like that's a super fair price for the quality and buying from a reputable brand like Anker. I have several of their items, and they have great customer service. I'd much rather spend the extra $10-20 from the super off brands here on Amazon, just for the peace of mind that they stand by their products.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AEX7BTHOU63GYGKQTAAC6HSPITZA,True,28,Color: Black
R325WZ955J5MAO,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Super-Solid Bang-For-Your-Buck Pair of Headphones!,Jordan Pon,4,"Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------Sound Quality ---- 8/10These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORSI only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.Comfort ---- 10/10These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.Features ---- meh, not much to talk aboutReally the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.Aesthetics ---- 6/10Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.Connectivity ---- 6/10Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2020",AF57TFFL4RVTI3RUQXVEO24IMNTQ,True,442,Color: Black
RTYYTUIZAG0EK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A Complete Review for the Average Joe,Kathy Tran,5,"This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.The Soundcore Headphones:These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.Comparability and Software:These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.Overall SoundI'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.Noise Cancelling:Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.Comparisons:Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.The Overall:Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020",AEBWJZ55L7XV3T354S22VM2GQK7Q,True,678,Color: Black
R3TBHJ0I0G4WY0,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best purchase for an overstimulated mom!,Alex G.,5,"Let me start by saying I wasn’t paid or given the product for free to say this….these are my genuine thoughts. I started looking for some over the ear headphones bc, as a mom to a small baby, I spend a lot of time awake at night on my phone trying to stay awake! I have regular Apple ear buds and never liked them bc they don’t stay in my ear at all. I chose this soundcore product bc it had the best reviews and was in my budget. I was immediately in love. I’m no expert in sound by no means but I do love music and love when things sound so clear and crisp. This delivers so well in that. The noise cancelling is my favorite part. As a mom to a very wild toddler, I can get overstimulated to the max. This makes it so that I can hear the screaming and laughing but it sounds like through a mile long tunnel, which is PERFECT. I’m sure other people would like more noise reduction but this is amazing for me to lessen all the noise but still be alert if needed. I suffer from migraines so the fit is a huge aspect to me. They seem very comfortable so far but using them for longer will surely tell. I wish there were more colors like a pale pink but I got the silver color and it is girly enough for me! It’s something I’d definitely wear outside the house at the gym or on a walk. They haven’t gone through a drop test yet which I’m sure they will bc again, wild toddler. But they seem to be durable and not super cheaply made. I do wish there was a hard case as all it came with was a rubber plastic bag. I’m sure I could find something cheap on Amazon though to fit. Overall, I LOVE IT. Definitely a good purchase if you want a little better experience than ear buds and not break the bank!","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AGCAPWOIW26ZZ3SHBSLOCOG62TXA,True,1,Color: Silver
R8FJIV29I1F67,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice headphones, works for sensitive heads too",T.M.,5,"Very pleasantly surprised, they are really nice.I have an extremely sensitive head and any pressure gives me headaches, so over ear headphones never work for me, but I saw a video recommending them for people like me, so gave it a try.Since getting them I wear them all the time, after several hours or on bad allergy days I do get a bit of a headache, but otherwise they are very comfortable, the squishy soft material is nice, and they're very light and gentle.Sound wise they sound great, and the mic seems to work good as well.For ANC, I originally thought it was supposed to mute outside sounds so I was disappointed, you can still hear well while wearing them, but it does soften noise.A few days ago the q30 was on sale and decided to try them for the better ANC (and the pink color lol), and there's very little difference between the two headphones, but I'm no sound aficionado.For the q30, the ANC and sound is customizable, the frame feels more sturdy, the ear cups are a tiny bit larger so slightly more comfortable on the ears, and it has USBC.Overall very nice, for some the q30 is definitely worth the extra $20, but for the average person who doesn't need the fancier sound tech, the q20 is just as good.I was leaning towards keeping the q30, but they're about 14grams heavier and my stupidly sensitive head can't wear them as long as the q20 T-T.I wish they'd make pink q20s...","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AHAUXVMB3X6IEVKLYM5QY4C4ODQA,True,0,Color: Silver

R2PRRSGGO8J48X,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars The Absolute BEST for Misophonia, Hyperacusis, and Sound/Sensory Sensitivity",sbonne,5,"I own so much sound defense equipment it's almost ridiculous. I have everything from Loop ear plugs to noise-canceling ear buds to sound machines to big speakers. I have a condition that makes certain sounds nd frequencies quite painful. Until now, every device I have tried had failed to provide complete relief. I wasn't expecting much of the Soundcore Q20 headphones, but if you struggle with sound sensitivity, you know the desperation for relief. My biggest battle has been my next door neighbor's lawn service, which uses equipment that measures over 90dB INSIDE my house with all the windows closed. I usually have to leave the house the moment I hear the truck pull up. Not anymore! I put the Soundcore Q20s to the test just this week, fully expecting that the lawn equipment (particularly the gas-powered leaf blowers) would make it through like it does all other devices I own, but it didn't! I was stunned! Even between songs, the noise cancellation kept my ears protected from the auditory assault I usually have to leave the house to escape. These are worth their weight in gold! I cannot recommend them enough. And in addition to being absolutely excellent at what they're designed to do, they provide great sound quality for music and they fit very comfortably. I don't usually like having things on or around my ears but these are quite tolerable. The cushioning feels nice, and there is more cushioning on the part that goes on top of your head. Oh, and the battery life? Phenomenal!! These charge quickly and the charge lasts for a very long time! Bottom line: whether you deal with hyperacusis, misophonia, sensory processing disorder, or just really value your peace and quiet, GET THESE. There are brands out there that cost a lot more and promise a better experience, but these are BY FAR superior to anything else I have ever tried. They will not disappoint! These would make a wonderful gift for the person in your life that struggles with sound or has autism or ADHD and needs relief from noise and external distractions. Literally a life-changing product. I'd give them more stars if I could!","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2024",AH3JNQIYXWKIX5M3KYYWBSX6J5KA,True,7,Color: Black

I would give these a 5 star overall review, but they are just a touch too big for my head, even at the smallest setting.

R2D5N7MVCP2FAP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud office? BUY THESE!,Katy Jordan,5,"Recently, a group of half a dozen younger, rather talkative, gentlemen were promoted to my department. I'm okay with chitchat at a nice reasonable level. But as the NBA Finals approached, their enthusiasm for daily conversations seemed to grow. I overheard rave reviews of various comedy and action films and television shows. I've listened to them flirt shamelessly with the one younger girl at their desk clump. I also overheard a particularly vivacious discussion about chewing gum that lasted approximately half an hour. It felt something akin to working in a locker room slash Dutch Bros. parking lot slash mall food court. Their volume grew. And grew. And I was afraid that one day I might be inclined to staple something to one of their heads if I heard one more thing about what the Mavericks can do to get more rebounds in the next game. My current earbuds were not working - I had to keep raising the volume, prolonged wearing made my ears itchy, and somehow I could still hear the boys! Desperate, I saw these headphones for a reasonable price and thought I'd take the chance.As soon as they were over my ears, it was like I'd stepped into an oasis. I could finally hear my own thoughts. Instant focus. I have become much more pleasant to be around. I no longer feel compelled to staple things to my coworkers heads. In fact, now I find these boys quite endearing and I hope all of their sports teams win.The noise cancelling is not perfect, but for the price it is amazing. I also have loop earplugs for concerts - if that helps as a reference point, these headphones cancel more noise than that. I don't have to turn the volume of my music up as high. They really are quite pleasant - that's the best word I can think of to describe them. They're adjustable, so they fit my head perfect, and perfectly cover my ears. I've heard other people say that other headphones start to feel heavy after a while and strain their necks - I have not felt that with these at all. They are comfortable, they look sleek, the battery seems to last forever, and I HIGHLY recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AH73MYPRDV2TK2KOUSR4BVVTMNCA,True,49,Color: Black
R3L3SZ6RUZTBSX,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding, but not without their flaws",Debbie Wiggins,4,"These headphones are a great value. They are extremely lightweight and sound quality is very good. Noise cancelling works well and is not far off from their more expensive counterparts. My main complaint with these is the size of the ear cups. They are quite small and just barely qualify as ""over ear"" headphones in my opinion. Part of the ear cup actually sat on top of my ear lobes. I found that this design along with the faux-leather material used made my ears overheat too quickly. That being said, I have issues with my ears getting hot with most headphones that I have tried, so take that with a grain of salt.It is important to mention that I could not get the noise cancelling feature to work when these were functioning off of the included cable. If you plan to use these wirelessly just for listening to music from your phone this likely isn't an issue, but I was considering using these for gaming so this did not fit my use case. In addition, I feel that these do not sound nearly as good with noise cancelling turned off. When noise cancelling is on, they sound amazing. With it off, however, they sound quite cheap and the clarity seems to decrease. I'm not sure what would cause this, but that is just my experience with them.I got these on sale for $40, so these are definitely a great value at that price point. If the negatives I mentioned are not deal breakers for you, I highly recommend picking these up when they are on sale.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHSWFP7XSW3WSEK2XFIOZOMVMP2A,True,3,Color: Black
R8A53BVTBUUTM,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!,Wendell Powell,5,"First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2020",AHAP5LT732R5D4AMGRRZYHQCNNJQ,True,489,Color: Black
R3JEJFEWVA44XJ,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Nice sound quality but the fit takes some getting used to,Whit,4,"The controls on the headphones are really easy to use whether you want to pause whatever you’re listening to or adjust the volume of your headphones without taking them off to troubleshoot (my last pair from a different brand were so hard to pause, adjust volume, etc so this is a really great perk for my new headphones). I ordered the black pair and they look great. They’re easy to connect with my Bluetooth on my phone however the distance I can be away from my phone while I am connected isn’t that great. But if you keep your phone on or near you while you use them it isn’t an issue. The noise canceling feature works pretty well. I haven’t tried them in a super busy and loud setting yet but they do a good job dulling the sound of my lawn mower and leaf blower while I’m doing my yard work. The fit takes some getting used to. If I wear them too long my ears get sore and the top of my head where the strap sits starts to hurt too. But I haven’t worn over the ear headphones in a really long time so it may just be that my head and ears need time to get used to the new set up. Overall for the price I’d recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AFTJWQAYUSUI7GS36WR3YK56W2IQ,True,1,Color: Black

I was blown away by the ability to be noise canceling at the touch of a button. These came in today and I’ve been wearing them all day! I can’t say that I notice any difference between them and the AirMax. I own a vast amount of headphones, most that I’ve gotten off Amazon below $30. These were the first pair I spent more on, got them for $39.99 on sale from $59.99. I’m just a headphone junkie. These are fantastic! I’m obsessed and they are now my favorite pair. I will probably be purging some old ones soon. They’re all fairly decent for how much I paid for them, but these are absolutely my favorite!

Placement is good and easy to use when on my head. Noise canceling works very well actually very quiet even without noise canceling on and works well for phone calls. I have even had people comment that it was clearer when i switched from my EarPod pros to this head set. Thinking of buying a few more to give away as gifts. Would purchase again. Connecting it to my iPhone was also super simple both thru Bluetooth and wired.

R3V6S1FQYWLWPU,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars An Honest, Unbiased Review **UPDATED**",Marc,4,"UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many ""name brand"" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless ""no-name"" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony & Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.PROSComfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.CONSNoise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2020",AFWC3HQORHDCFQJN4P76FBRXOI7A,True,33,Color: Black
R3LYQ2WI5N0KRF,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good For Our TV Use, But Question the BT 5.3 Rating",Bob in Central Oregon,5,"We bought two of these to use for TV listening. We have a large difference in how much TV volume we need, and the easiest solution is two headphones with individual volume adjustments. I have a long history of success with Anker products so had no problem selecting these from the large assortment of BT headphones available on Amazon in this cost class. At the same time I bought a https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G8Q7NXZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details transceiver for the TV, also with BT 5.3 low-latency claimed.The headphones paired easily with the transceiver. The sound quality is fine, and they link up quickly when powered on. The only disappointment is that there's a very noticeable lag in the audio, even with both components claiming the low-latency with BT 5.3. Unfortunately I have no other BT 5.3 pieces to substitute to isolate the cause of the lag. Since they will be used with the TV speaker turned off, the lag isn't as critical an issue as it might be if the TV speaker was still audible while wearing the headphones. Were I serious about testing/solving, I'd me much more inclined to swap he transceiver first.I did the first test while pairing with the transceiver plugged into my tablet, listening to a music stream. My vintage (read: old) ears liked the bass-boost function for the music, so one set of headphones has that selected. K has hearing loss in upper mid to treble range so bass boost would not benefit her, and in fact would be counterproductive. Hers is switched off. Nice to have that easy option. I have no other sound options selected at this early time.Yes I would buy them again. They are comfortable, fold nicely if I was planning to pack them for travel, certainly light weight on the head, and they will serve our needs nicely.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AGEBMVNXJABW4OKRV2MP7NS6FX6A,True,3,Color: Black

Mumola,5,"I usually use in ear wireless buds when it comes to cutting my lawn with my tractor, but the motor bleeds in and the music is not very enjoyable because of that. I went online to review over the ear wireless headphones and the first ones on the list were Bose at a hefty price of somewhere around $250. I was gonna buy them but then I saw these as the 2nd on the list at $49!!They mention the “active noise reduction” feature, so I figured, ya can’t go wrong with that price these days. The reviews were plentiful but, I’m very weary of excessive Amazon reviews because, for the most part, it basically tells me that the product was inexpensive.Nevertheless I purchased them and WOW!Syncing to my iPhone was a breeze.

R5SDX41KD57A9,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones,Steven Lavey,5,"I've been using thease headphones for a while now and I feel like I've tested them enough to give a long term review. The headphones work great from day 1. They came partially charged. Disregarding the advice of plugging in and giving a full charge before use, used it all the way to see how long it would take to fully charge. First full charge was about 2 hours. Every full charge has been between 30 to 90 minutes. This is due to the quality of charger and cord used. In the instructions it says it has a quick charge mode where 5 minutes of charge gives 2 hours. I've found this is incorrect. 5 minutes of charge gives about 2.5 hours of use at minimum. I can usually get a full or nearly full charge at 45 minutes at average. Standby mode with headphones is the longest I've seen. I powered on the headphones and needed to do something, forgot about it until 2 days later. At 2 days standby with Noise cancelation on, the charge was about 20%. Noise cancelation works great. I've been using the headphones while doing woodworking. I doubt the headphones are OSHA approved but they work great with background noise. When I was listening to anything, I did not need to adjust the volume to hear anything. While I know this company as a very reliable company for USB cords and chargers, the headphones and earbuds they make are some of the best I've used and an excellent value. The only recommendation I would make is to change the charging port from micro USB to USB C, but I'm sure they've already corrected it with other models. There's not many companies out there that I'd ever consider myself a fan of, let alone recommend their products to close family members, this company is certainly one I do.

I wasn't particularly fascinated by how low the sound was at first, especially with my music player mediums being at full volume... BUT THEN I eventually realized that the Noise Cancellation feature had something to do with that, so I turned it off. The EQ quality is spotless; the clarity and balance is top notch! The bass boost is very enjoyable, the product aesthetic is excellent, I love that it comes with a case for carrying and packing, the buttons are straightforward, and the headphones seem to fit well over small heads and big heads, Haha! Audiophile folks may indulge in the ANC technology, but I prefer it with that feature off because more power is needed to make the sonics more attractive to me. I prefer my headphones and earbuds to be loud enough for me to fully submerge myself in the music, so I can drown in the frequencies to catch the vibe of each song.I started with ""New Review"" because this is a modification of my prior review. I deleted my old review after discovering that turning off the ANC feature gives me the kind of loudness I enjoy when listening to music.

R1V2HAPIO5YL64,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars No noise cancelling, instead this is more like pump up the volume",William Yousef Fadel,4,"Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want ""world around dissapears"" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointingEdit #1:The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says ""Noice Cancelling"", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent) sure noice cancelling was active.«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.Edit #2:I was ""finally"" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and ""- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference."".For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song ""A a a a a a a a a Very good song"" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.I tested in various scenarios:1.) In my car, windows down.2.) In my car windows up.3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.My results:1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.But, in scenarios 5, 6 & 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.Edit #3 (and Final):Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2020",AF2NHPCDCZUYJXEC4KAFWB73FFRA,True,16,Color: Black

The noise cancellation is very weak, basically non-existent it seems to only filter out lows, like I can still hear my fan running in my window 15ft from me. Controls are simple and easy to use. My main gripe is that every time you move you can hear the various joints and whatnot creaking. Overall for like sitting watching a movie without disturbing your partner, grand, but I wouldn't use them as like day-to-day walking around cans if you really love your music. Would not personally buy again but they serve their purpose as cheapos after my last good ones fell apart from years on years of use and abuse.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AG6WHJ4ENPTJVLFSALGUUFJ4YBHQ,True,0,Color: Black

Sure. They’re not Sony. They’re not Sennheiser. But if you’re like me and you just need some tunes to tune out the world when you’re commuting, walking, working, or eating, these do the job.Keep in mind, I treat my headphones like garbage. I lost the case/bag it came in so any time I don’t need it, it gets stuffed in my backpack or thrown somewhere for me to find later. After more than a year of this kind of use, it’s still sturdy and holding strong. I haven’t even put duct tape on it, which is more than what I can say about my previous pair.Will I get the same exact pair after this inevitably dies? …No. There are better options out there nowadays. But if you’re looking for a gift for a cranky high schooler or a new college admit…hell, I’d do anything for a pair of these my freshman year in college rather than the 5 other bad, dollar-store hand-me-downs I went through.Brief description about its functionality because you might need to keep this in mind: They’re very comfortable. I’ve fallen asleep in these before. However, they do have a tendency to slip off after continuous usage so I don’t really recommend this if you’re looking to run or jog or work out. They fold in, which is great for storage. They sit around my neck easily but I have weird sensory issues with that so I don’t usually rest them there. (It’s not uncomfortable but it’s also not comfortable.) And one final thing: lately, they’ve needed a LOT of time to charge. HOWEVER, even since I’ve gotten these headphones, they last an INCREDIBLE amount of time. I think my first few times using it I’ve literally had it on 5-7 hours a day for like, two weeks, and it still has charge on it. The battery life is god tier. Nowadays, it has been more like 4-6 hours for 1 1/2-2 weeks before I need to charge it. I’ve left these suckers on during classes and meetings and man, I’m always surprised by the voice telling me I’m still on a medium charge.Don’t take my word for it though. I got a couple of friends who have been rocking their own pairs of q25s for about as long as I have, if not longer.These are solid. If you don’t want to break the bank, I’d recommend these. $300-400 for a pair of headphones in this economy?? 🤧","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AEYTP46M5XLLQ4WHQ54KZK742HVQ,True,6,Color: Black

With that being said, as far as cost goes, Anker is up there in price, but not the MOST expensive. For the price point on noise cancelling headphones, I went with these and let me tell you they are AMAZING! I know someone that paid twice as much for their noise cancelling headphones and I like these better! The noise cancelling is a God send, its helps me study and relax in peace. If you only have noise cancelling on and no other noise playing, you will still hear SOME noise, but it is much more muted and quiet. The sound quality on these far exceeds my expectations. If you need heavy, heavy bass, these might not be for you, but they do the job for me. The charge for me, lasts days, with the headphones being on for multiple hours per day. One downfall I want to mention is you cannot use these and charge them at the same time (unless maybe I'm dong something wrong), but that wasn't a huge deal for me anyway as I just let them charge overnight. These are soooooo great, I let my friend borrow them and he ended up buying himself and his mom a pair!

Having already bought a set of Life A20 buds and paired it with the anker app on my phone, I went to work trying to add the new headphones. My pixel paired with them immediately, but the Soundcore app couldn't find the new device. I tried multiple obvious fixes (dump cache on phone app, reset headphones, reinstall phone app, etc.) and ended up using the soundcore app to dial US Cust. Support. They answered very quickly with a human, repeated the steps I had already done, and very quickly offered to send me a brand new unit as this one was faulty. They also told me not to sweat returning the old one. All around top notch CS experience, and that was the only problem with the unit.

Green,5,"I saw these on a Today's Deal sale, and like a drug addict that likes hopscotch, I busted out the chalk sidewalk and started researching.Everyone loves these headphones. Your mom will love these headphones. They are not $300 Bose ANC headphones. (ANC stands for Always Be Closing. Sit Down. Coffee is for closers.) But they are 80-90% as good as Bose Active Noise Cancelling headphones at 1/5 the cost. You'll need to ask your kid or younger brother to help with that Algebra, but let's just say x = incredible value.Apparently Soundcore is an Anker company. This isn't obvious in some of the reviews you will undoubtedly read while on the toilet. But it's Anker made. Who hasn't had great experience with Anker stuff? Your purchase history here on Amazon already has 14 Anker purchases. This won't be your first or your last Anker purchase. Aside from making you feel dumb with your friends because no one can agree how to pronounce the ""a"" in Anker, their products are solid performers at a good price.And that's how I'd describe these headphones - like a really nice Honda amongst Acura, Lexus, etc. Or a really good TV dinner where they get the cheese right. These Soundcores are not beautiful. They won't help you get the girl (or the guy. or the cute non-binary person you saw Wednesday). But they absolutely will make you feel glad you bought them.They are solid in the hand, if a little cheap feeling - but only next to high end headphones. They aren't flimsy by any stretch (do not try to stretch them). The plastic is thick and has a matte finish. The headband adjustment is solid - easy to move and stays in place once set. Comfort is excellent. The earphone cushions are buttery soft (and not all greasy like butter. That would be gross. Butter on your ears sucks.) The soft ear cushions make a great seal on your ears and don't hurt after wearing for hours, even with glasses.Some reviewes mention that these headphones can get a little sweaty. That does not mean the headphones themselves. These headphones produce almost zero perspiration themselves. But they may make your head/ears/ear area sweat. Because of the great seal made by the cushions, and due to the material being all natural vinyl or something, it can make things a little warm after an hour. But if you're sitting at the bus stop in this humid heat, your ears are gonna sweat. At least these headphones will protect your ears from the loud noises of the bus and the other people at the bus stop who won't stop talking about Sammy and why he took off. You don't need to hear that story again. Poor Sammy.The ANC (not the chain of movie theaters) is good. For headphones at this price, the noise cancelling is excellent. So I guess that means the noise cancelling is excellent. At this price. These aren't high end Bose, dum-dum. These will remove a lot of exterior sound like a droning fan, dogs barking, a baby crying, a spouse asking you to do something, a police officer telling you that you can't lie here, a drive through operator asking you want you want over and over and over.I haven't tried these on a plane yet. But I will. If I say I'll come back and update this review after using them on a plane, that would feel disengenuous, because we both know that's not going to happen. I feel like there is a modicum of trust and intimacy established at this point, and I don't want to harm that. So let's just agree to disagree, OK? I bet these will be great on a plane.Sound is really really good. I won't say excellent because you might like artificially enhanced Beats-like bass response, and if you do, trying to explain what ""subjective"" means will take too long. I'm kidding. If you really like a bunch of bass, that doesn't mean you are stupid. I don't think calling someone stupid is OK. You just have terrible taste and judgment and probably only give 40% effort at everything.These sound clear and crisp. Bass response is good without being overbearing. (for those who really like heavy bass, that has nothing to do with bears).Sound is great. Really great. Way better than those earbuds you've been using that start to feel uncomfortable after 45 minutes. Go on, take the plunge. I promise you will happy with your purchase and grateful to me and then we can be friends. You will love these headphones. Later, you will learn to love me.I can tell you are losing interest. I know that look. I'll wrap this up. Buy these headphones. You won't be disappointed. Get a cheap hard case. I found one on Amazon for around $9. Now you have noise cancelling g headphones that sound great, fit great, last a very long time on a single charge, and you'll invest way under $100 all in. You will be the envy of your friends.

The headband weighs down on your head and the cushion makes them sit heavily on your head. Just not comfortable long term. These are light and comfortable with cushion ear cups that feel nice on your ears. As for what I'm not fond of, it seems like it takes a while to turn off when I push the power button. The noise canceling is okay and isn't up to some other higher end brands, but it's not bad. I love the extended playtime but wish the charging cord was longer and a USB C configuration, so I don't have to swap around cords for this and other devices.

RKHKXMSIWHYZW,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect, and better than the newer versions",Amazon Customer,4,"TL;DR -- these are the best noise canceling headphones, and they perform at or above the level of more expensive headphones. I tried the newer Q30 version and switched back to these Q20s due to the better performance.I bought these about a year ago, and I've loved them. The noise cancellation is excellent--my sister was showing me the noise cancellation on her new AirPods Max and it was comparable these Q20s. I get easily overwhelmed by lots of noise, so the noise canceling feature was the most important to me when selecting headphones. I use these to block out my husband watching TV, dogs barking, neighbors blasting music in my apartment building, people talking loudly on airplanes, etc. They are excellent, and I can wear them for several hours before my ears start to get a little sore. The battery life on the headphones is also really good. I'm not a huge audiophile so I can't really tell you if the sound quality is as good as more expensive headphones, but I have no complaints about the sound when I'm listening to music.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that I can only connect to one device at a time. If I'm using them for my laptop and I get a call on my phone, I can't take the call on my headset without manually switching the bluetooth connection over. This bothered me enough to try the newer Q30 headphones, which can connect to two devices simultaneously and also have a little feature that switches from noise cancellation mode to transparency mode when you tap the right earphone. After a couple weeks of trying them out, I am returning the Q30s and going back to my Q20s. The newer headphones had less effective noise cancellation, and I would occasionally get a sharp piercing sound in my ear through the headphones that was a little painful. Some of this could be the shape of my ears or whatever, but I found the Q20s to be more comfortable with better noise cancellation, and a much better price point. I can live with the minor inconvenience of the single bluetooth connection in exchange for better noise cancelation.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AEYVMYSZVTBHXNPGVOTMJ5G3JRTQ,True,88,Color: Blue

R1FHD65JDCCMGU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars O.M.G. (for the price),Giblet Gravey,5,"Just got these, but had to say they really sound AWESOME! These provide the best sound I've ever heard via streaming Apple music, and that is compared with my Audio-Technica hard-wired M50s and my Beats Studio Buds (and some cheaper headphones/ear-buds). I'm also comparing this with a good $200 DAC and high-end Bluetooth loudspeakers (or again the M50s).With default settings (ANC on, no EQ) there was a noise-floor and too much bass. The ANC defaults to on, so the first thing I do is turn that OFF (...every time I turn-on the headphones...). I have no use for ANC, and find any ANC does ""funny things"" to my ears, even ignoring the noise-floor.Next, I'm using Apple music, lossless, so my source material is good. Then, I use Boom 3D and my Android phone. I use Boom 3D pretty much everywhere, since I often like compression for those podcasts or movies with volume ""all over the place"", but that's just Windows. Here, with these headphones on Android, Boom 3D is limited to the basic functions (EQ, and a bit of DSP effects). Anyway, after using Boom 3D's EQ to dial-down the bass (BTW, the bass-boost on the headphones is INSANE: not for me, and BTW I'm a bass-player), I was SHOCKED how good these headphones sounded!S H O C K E D !Hey, they are still $60 headphones (not the strongest build-quality, ANC has to be turned-off every time), but for the price (...and I got them on sale...), I am VERY happy.I realize not everyone uses Boom 3D (worth a try, BTW), but I do suggest having some EQ handy to dial-down the bass, or otherwise tune these to your preferences. The mids and highs are there, but these are definitely bass-heavy by default.","Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2024",AHUBR44TJTI4UC2DE6ZLDA4C7WIA,True,0,Color: Black

Sound is great I don’t have much comparison to other tho.

So far when I used them for a couple hours it hasn’t happened tho be aware I think the most amount I used them have been 4 hours maybe. I used them when I’m cooking or cleaning too since the duration of the battery is so long which is a plus. For music and audiobooks are great. If you want something cheaper I’ll go for this ones.

At first I put the headphones on and played some hip hop to see how the depth of bass and crispness of the mids and highs are and I thought it sounded GREAT... but wasn't blown away. These are not expensive so it was exactly what I thought it would be BUT..... I finally read the manual and there's a button you click 2 times. I clicked it 2 times and IMMEDIATELY smiled. The clear deep bass coming from this little headset is amazing! Even at 100% volume up, its crystal clear and absolutely no distortion at all. I feel like I have a pair or JBLs or Beats on. It's a no brainer on buying these. I'm going to order 3 more for my kids. They tried them on and they LOVE them. They always lose the little expensive earbuds. Can't lose these. The only thing I would wish better would be... the placement of buttons. When you fold them up, the power button on the left ear touches the right ear and turns on every time! If you don't notice this, it will be constantly on. Even so, it really won't matter because they must have alien technology because the battery life on these mamajammaz are absolutely insane.

I am happy with this purchase.However, there are two things that I don't like about this headphone that could've been very very easy to fix:The off button is moody - almost every time, i have to double check that it actually turned off the headphones, because many times, pressing & holding it for 3 seconds (like the manual says) does absolutely nothing.Second, the USB port is USB Micro, rather than USB C. This is the only new device I bought in the last few years that uses USB Micro, and whenever I need to charge it I need to scramble for my one usb mini cable. While USB C I have everywhere, since that's the standard.Sound-wise, the headphones deliver pleasantly colored sound - these are not studio monitors, they prettify what you hear, and for me that's a good thing. The noise cancellation is soft, if that's the most important feature for you, look elsewhere. For me it's ok, reduces ambient noise but doesn't feel like a vacuum.Overall, 3 stars generally and 1 additional star for the great price.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AHLUTP5Z23FAXPIWTWVMJF7ZJZEA,True,10,Color: Black

They fit quite good with one exception - I wish they could be snugger. When I lay on a weight bench or bend over for specific exercises, they start to slide forward/back. Given the quality of the sound and cancellation I can live with this. And considering the price which is perfect.Note about every 10 minutes the music momentarily stops (1 second). I don't care about that.Very good buy.Update 17 June - the fit has significantly loosened to the point they start sliding off when I look up or down.

Way better than other headphones I have tried in the same price range $40-60. This is my third set of Soundcore products. I have been pretty happy with each of them, which is why I was comfortable going a bit beyond my initial budget.The noise canceling works great and has the option of being turned off. It's amazing to feel the sense of silence that the active noise canceling creates. Great for sensory processing, even when using this feature without music or a movie.The on/off/connected sounds and voice are pleasant and the volume for these can be adjusted independent of the headset volume. No loud annoying voice breaking my ear drum to let me know it's on, or the battery is low.Sound is crisp and clear with good mid tones and bass. I have only used these for watching movies so far but they seem to have a good range and I can actually hear background noises in films that I hadn't been able to pick up on before. The listening experience is pleasant and encompassing.I took one phone call so far and I could hear the other person well. They seemed to hear me fine. I did not ask for their feedback so I'm unsure of the sound quality in that regard.The control buttons are easy to understand and use and the headset itself is adjustable and comfortable. I do have a small head so every full headset like this is always just a fraction too large, but with this set it doesn't hurt my head or ears. I have piercings and the soft ear cups do not irritate them.Only downside is that the charging port is for a micro-usb, but that is just a minor inconvenience.So far the charge lasts me a few days with some pretty heavy use, including leaving them on when I pause a show and get caught up doing something else.Easy to connect via Bluetooth. I have not tried these line-in yet.Good purchase, even at normal price. I usually put a lot of effort researching different products to find affordable items that are still good quality.

I managed to figure it out finally, but what's wrong with having a simple diagram that points to and identifies each of the three buttons on the headphones. It's also difficult to see the black on black buttons. Letters and markings are etched or pressed into the plastic. How hard would it be to apply a bit of white or red paint so that the functions are easier to see? I even need a flashlight to determine which side is L and which is R.

Grabbed these since the price was right and I could get them from Amazon overnight.I wasn't expecting them to be as good as my Sonys, but they did surprise me, ESPECIALLY at their price point. These things punch well above their price.-Noise Cancelling: not as good as the XM3s, but enough to dull the engine roar and passenger chatter, which was all I was expecting. 4 stars here, as I'm not sure you'd get a better ANC experience without spending 3x as much.-Sound Quality: very impressed, for the price. A little muddy in the mids/highs, but these aren't audiophile headphones. Bass was fantastic (regardless of price).-Comfort/Build: on the cheap side (but they're under $50, so well within expectations). 5 hours on the plane with no issues, plenty of battery life remaining. I wear a 7 5/8 hat, so I struggle finding headphones that don't squeeze my melon - these were completely fine.If you have $50 and need some decent BT headphones, get these.

R1ENMZ4L0A2RHB,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Great speakers - short cord!,Bway Jack,4,"I bought these to replace some ancient headphones I use with my laptop, mostly watching video from a chair. They're really comfortable, sit nicely on the ear, great noise cancellation from external sources. The only negative is that the connecting cord to the laptop is pretty short - I wear them backward because the cord doesn't reach far enough to wear the right earpiece over my right ear. (The pin's on the left side of my laptop.) It's sitting right there on my actual lap....","Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2024",AFR4GDWS7B5CC5VSXKTCGNKAVS3A,True,0,Color: Black
R3MD4WA0TF9CQA,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product,Veronica R.,5,So far these headphones have been great. They are extremely comfortable. I am a glasses wearer and these don't push against my glasses making it uncomfortable. Three volume level on them are really good. For the price the noise cancelation is great. There is a button so you can turn the noise cancelation on or off. I would buy again,"Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2024",AHISMXBLDMHZMVQLNYTIU2X7NXVQ,True,0,Color: Black
R1PY8XCICMG1L3,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars So comfortable....and has great distance,friday,4,I love these. And I'm sure you noticed I did not give them a 5 star. Comparing these new Soundcore to my ol' J6.....not much of a comparison in noise cancelling and those other features. But having built in radio and play SD cards would make it a definite 10 out of 5 stars.The Soundcore is great as I like to watch videos thru my 'puter.,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AHZGOWE4R6MVKEQXBBFFIMIKITMQ,True,0,Color: Black
R1C9R168CQ34AO,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound!,Leanne Glover,5,"We purchased these (2 sets) primarily to use on our first international flight. Knowing we’d be on the plane for hours, we wanted some headphones that would drown out noise and enhance the quality of the music or movies we were listening to. Well these headphones did JUST that!! They are great quality and we continue to enjoy them even after our trip!","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AERUS3NJ4Y4P3OCH7JJQA6CYA5OQ,True,0,Color: Black
R32YBQVAJB3ZHZ,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars *update* Vendor sent replacement, great customer service! (Stopped charging after 10 months)",Charles W.,4,"Good customer service wins the day, they gave me some troubleshooting steps and when they failed they shipped me new headphones right away. Very friendly and prompt responses, and a great result. I hope my original pair dying on me was a fluke and these ones go the distance as they are really good for the price.*prior review*These headphones worked really well until today. They no longer charge and even after following the steps on the website nothing seems to help (changed the cable, reset, etc). I really liked the quality up until now so it's a shame. If you want headphones that last I'd avoid these.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AEUECORDUSCAWOXOVANTGAWXR5UA,True,0,Color: Black
