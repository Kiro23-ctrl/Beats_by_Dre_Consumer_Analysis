R387VQO0IULZOU,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars No more sweaty ears!,Michal,5,"I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2022",AEHP2RZXKFSJ563FSDU5WFMGK7MA,True,37,Color: SandSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R2P5659UWIUH6I,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars They're Very Good,Ethan Barbee,5,"I've been using these for several months now. Originally I gave them 4 stars and a good review, but they're better than that. They're easy to connect to my phone and the B&O app has a fantastic equalizer on it.They're best for voice and instrument clarity. Beautiful. Individual percussion pieces are clear. The only deficit they have would be bass. But I'm not a bass guy so that works for me.They're beautiful comfortable and sound great. Highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023",AEOMNSFUKAOLDVBX7HYX64VEXTEQ,True,5,Color: TimberSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R1TIPXHNTF7XSK,B08YJ3W1HB,4.0 out of 5 stars B&O HX vs Bose NC 700- Bose is the better buy,Cathy White,4,"Recently purchased both the Bang & Olufsen HX headphones and the Bose NC 700 headphones for comparison. My biggest must haves in over the ear headphones are sound quality, call quality and comfort.Call quality The B&O HX’s call quality is not up to par with Bose. While on a phone call walking outdoors wearing the B&O HX’s, the person on the other end of the call said the background noise was deafening and they could not hear me over the noise (city traffic and wind). I switched to the Bose while on the same call and it was worlds better, lowered background noise, and they could hear me much clearer. Bose won this test!Sound QualityThe sound quality of the B&O HX’s was good, however the sound quality depreciates when I switch over to noice canceling. Throughout all modes and different genres of music I noticed the bass is lacking and they focus more on the lyrics and spoken words rather than the music and lyrics. The Bose however blew me out of the water with sound quality, excellent bass, great clarity, and better EQ controls to customize to your liking. Bose wins here as well.ComfortThe B&O HX’s are comfortable headphones with amazing build quality. However the earpiece shape is more round than the Bose and did get uncomfortable after about an hour of use. I also found they struggle to stay planted on my head when I’m moving around quickly (not ideal for running or working out). The Bose however have a silicone lining on the upper arm and stay put on my head when running. Bose also won here!Overall the B&O HX’s are good headphones with excellent features and build quality but at $500 and compared to the Bose NC 700 headphones at $300 I could not justify the higher price tag. I need over the ear headphones to be a device I can use at work to take phone calls and video meetings, at the gym, on an outdoor walk, and on a plane. I feel as though the Bose are the better buy but glad I compared both to find the front runner!","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2023",AFIV6EERHINRWYBMBWFSJBZ5Q3AA,True,40,Color: TimberSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R3D58316QDF388,B08YJ3W1HB,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, meh noise cancellation, terrible Bluetooth",DVIR VOLK,3,"The good: They sound great, very crisp sound without too much bass. They're also pretty comfortable, but if you're moving around, say cleaning your house or something, they will fall off your head. Also, great battery life.The bad:1. HORRIBLE Bluetooth handling. Once you pair them to two devices, even if you're nowhere near the second device, upon turning them on, expect a few minutes of glitchy audio getting constantly cut, until it becomes okay. The only remedy to this is to factory reset the headphones and not pair them with more than one device. Again, this happens even nowhere near the second device.2. Iffy touch interface. I still can't reliably skip or pause with the touch interface. Volume is a bit more reliable and has a nice gesture to it.3. Pretty mediocre to sub par NC. Really unimpressive compared to Sony or Bose.In short, I would never buy these knowing what I know now, especially for such a high price.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",AGTD6Q3E7CICZW2AADBOP5VJ2URA,True,14,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

Top voice and instrument clarity, I’m a classical music listener and you just can’t go wrong with using B&O. My ears are a bit small so the auto-detect feature sometimes pause when I’m still having them on, but it’s okay I can pause myself. If you’re looking at something around the similar 400-500 price range (ahem AirPods Max) this is definitely the best pick with top sound quality and elegant look!","Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2024",AE6BJ7CV6NFQ2ZWPMX5Q7Y2WY2SA,True,3,Color: Gold ToneSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R13V05PPNZ72D3,B08YJ3W1HB,1.0 out of 5 stars Terrible Build Quality,Ajd041,1,"I've owned B&O headphones since starting back in 2017 with the h6i, a wired headset that sounded and looked like no other I've ever had since. When the earcups stared to really wear out a couple years later I switched to some H4's, and then an H9i as a surprise Christmas gift.When the H9i's started having battery issues last year I replaced those (fortunately I still kept them to use as wired headphones at my desk) originally with the Beoplay Portal, which had horrible sound quality so I returned them, and I got these instead, the HX. God I wish I never did. They sound much better than the portals but have completely fallen apart on me in a year of normal use in ways none of the other pairs I've owned ever did.I am accustomed to needing to replace Bluetooth headphones every 2-3 years as a matter of course. I have chosen to stay with B&O because their combination of cool aesthetics and good sound (I've kind of weirdly gotten many compliments over the years about having a pair of these around my neck). The HX's sound stage is slightly more muddled in the mids than the H9i, especially when playing in Bluetooth. The controls are less fiddly than the H9i's and the leather felt softer.The build quality, however, is horrible. I'm used to having spots in the leather after daily driving them for years. What I am not used to, is the glue (or whatever) holding the earcups together to totally fall apart and expose the admittedly soft foam to the outside world. They did this just over one year of ownership, meaning I'm out of warranty, and replacement earcups are not available as far as I can tell as they were with previous B&O models.I'm not sure what to do with them at this point. I work from home so I still listen to them in bed from time to time but clearly they're literally falling apart after such a short time. B&O's quality seems to have really fallen off a cliff. Stay away from these if you want something that lasts.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2023",AGL2IYGUX266Q2V24CNVUZYH5CYQ,True,8,Color: SandSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R93OTMYM51J5J,B08YJ3W1HB,4.0 out of 5 stars Very Good Headphones!,jacqueline,4,"I will say these are a very good set of headphones. Not perfect. But good.I'm just not having the issues I've read in a few bad reviews here. Everything works fine on mine. Volume control, next play swipe both work fine. The noise canceling is satisfactory to me. I know there are some that may be better in that department. But they are good enough.The other high points about these are that they are very light and comfortable and after hours wearing still no issue hurting my ears or feeling heavy. They completely seal around my ears making for a truly great experience.The very long battery life is a major plus too.I've owned good headphones that only last like 4 or 5 hours and that's a deal breaker for me because I wear them all the time.Now I own numerous pairs of headphones and my Master and Dynamics mw65's are quite good too. Especially if you hook them up through an audio cable and it really increases the sound quality like 10 times better than the Bluetooth function on that pair. That's really the only way I use them. They also are a little heavy and don't make a perfect seal around the ears. But I am curious on how the new mw75's, that Master and Dynamics just came out with, sound like and if they've increased the sound quality in Bluetooth mode.Overall after about 10 hours of break in on these B/O HX's, they sound very well. They do need a break in period.I know that everyone might not agree and are picky beyond belief, but these are worth the money. High quality build and sound. I definitely would buy again.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2022",AG3E6BMSP3SNWHP7ZHUBU4VLDFWA,True,12,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

What stood out the most was the build quality and sounds - top notch!! Some quirks, listed below.1. Sound: OMG amazing. The finesse, the quality of sound is the best I have heard. The experience is exquisite, in that you can really pick apart instruments, vocals and mids and the bass. The lows are balanced and refined - this is not going to rattle your head, so bass heads stay clear. These headphone really shine for any genre that emphasizes vocals and instruments. Volume does not get crazy, probably a good thing!2. Connectivity: Top notch, power on and instant pair. Multi device use was seamless, pause on one, easily play on the next device. Pulling connection from a third device to a paired one was also quick.3. Build & Comfort. Excellent build, feels premium and great in the hands. My only issue was the ear cups being round and not accommodating the largish ears. Clamp force was just fine as well.4. Features: ANC vs. Normal - barely any difference. Touch controls for volume took some getting used to. Would have much preferred physical buttons.5. Call quality: sub par compared to others.Returned these with a lot of hesitation, if it physically fit me properly I would have kept and overlooked the quirks.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2022",AH3ZBPFX5ODXKM2Y76QGSRIERAVA,True,15,Color: TimberSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R35H3RVKKSEKR8,B08YJ3W1HB,3.0 out of 5 stars Volume control unforgivably bad,Jeff Bellune,3,"Pros:- Very high quality materials- Beautiful design- ComfortableCons:- Volume control unusable for me. After several hours of practice I still couldn't control it reliably or oftentimes at all.- Sound quality very disappointing. Not awful, just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.Deal-breakers for me on any headphone or earbud are shouty, sibilant treble and fiddly controls. The HXs suffer from fiddly controls. I could swipe forward and back pretty reliably, but volume control was well nigh impossible for me.The sound quality was warm and smooth, but it really lacked any life at all in the top end. I know I'm fussy; first I don't want shouty treble and then I say I want life and liveliness in the top end. Well, I want what I want. For reference, my AirPods Max have life in the top end, which only ever overpowers me on poorly-mixed tracks. Ditto for sibilant consonants.I gave the HXs a go because I wanted a better wired option than my AirPods Max or my Jabra 85h for listening connected to a DAC. The Jabras have a very good sound, but Apple Music Hi-Res lossless and TIDAL MQA expose a thin-sounding weak spot in the male vocal range that gets annoying after a while. I'm looking for something better. I know the Jabras and the HXs are primarily bluetooth headphones, but I wanted something that could be wired for Hi-Res listening without jumping into the deep end of the pool of audiophile wired headphones.I'm returning these for the (essentially) broken volume control design.","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2022",AETXWAJP5XE22OFS2R7N4FYWRW3A,True,6,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
RIGAEGX7QU7SC,B08YJ3W1HB,3.0 out of 5 stars Very elegant but sound not so impressive,ALESSANDRO CHIOCCHETTI,3,"Sadly returning. I really wanted to like them. I love the brand and own four of their Bluetooth speakers, more importantly for years I enjoyed very much the H9i. Sadly I haven't enjoyed their new line of headphones. I bought a pair of H95 then returned because they are quite uncomfortable, I believe this is primarily because of their excessive weight but excessive clamping force and shape of the ear pads aren't a plus either.Disappointingly not much to be excited about their sound, moreover costing just about the double of everything else out there, to possibly offset the discomfort in wearing this $900 pair of headphones.Too much disappointment for too much money.I really wanted to continue to wear the beautifully built B&O so I ordered the HX. Now I'm back in H9i territory. Very comfortable headphone built with high quality materials and with a stunning look.However while they sound better than my old H9i and have a much improved noise cancellation circuit the HX can't compete with the incredibly refined sound of the cheaper and ultralight weight Sennheiser Momentum 4 nor with their even better noise cancellation feature.I really hated the idea to return the stunning looking HX but the sound of the Momentum 4 is so superior that the far superior aesthetics of the HX was not enough to win me.","Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2022",AGYKIFRBRJB2MUFEKZBU35X6V2KA,True,8,Color: TimberSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R90RGUEZFLB29,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars Clarity and Space,Alric the Red,5,"If I had to pay for these, Beoplay HX headphones, they would have been, by far, the most expensive headphones I've ever purchased. But I didn't have to pay for them, because I got them by redeeming points on my Visa credit card. But, that said, after experiencing them, I think I'd have paid for them if had known how good they are.I have used headphones for fifty years, off and on, and consistently for the last twenty-five. They are, for me, a necessary component for enjoying music. After years of searching for the ultimate isolated aural experience, I recognized that what I'm after is unattainable: a bass punch that'll rival the same impact you'd get during a live performance; or from grand speakers in your living room. That's simply not possible, because bass during those circumstances is a full-body experience. So the key is to settle for an immersive facsimile. Clarity will then be a key.These headphones are very clear, with sound that seems to come from a distance from the ears. In another review here, the customer said that they had no bass. This does not concur with my own experience, as the bass, to me, stood out, with distinct notes, so that they didn't become lost in a general blurry boom. The same customer also stated that the headphone volume was too low. When I first got these, I had the same problem. The headphones also had a serious issue with connectivity to my devices. After contacting Bang & Olufsen, they recommended a factory reset. This fixed both problems, and I haven't had a problem since, and I've been loving them. At home, I use them exclusively (for the gym, where I might sweat, I use some JBL's I bought for about $80).I recommend them. They're clearly not the most expensive pair of headphones you can buy, but if you're not some tech person or a DJ with very specific demands, these will more than meet your needs._________________________________________","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023",AH7V5DNF4CKNGQ7EFNFXM7YWSQNQ,False,0,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R2KBC7C12RY9KP,B08YJ3W1HB,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing headphones all around. Jack of all trades, master of... everything.",mbulan,5,"Just wanted to mention that I did not buy these from Amazon, I bought them directly from the B&O online store.I'm going to be truthful because I'm a big fan of B&O. The Beoplay HXs sound, feel, and look very amazing. I don't know really where to start the review.Sound quality: Your typical B&O sound quality. Beautiful, clean, crisp, doesn't sacrifice any instrument, thumping bass but it's not obnoxious or distorts other instruments and/or vocals. Music separation is fantastic. Not like open back or closed-back headphones that are meant to be plugged into an AMP/DAC but it's damn near close. My favorite out-of-the-box sound signature/sound quality brand of headphones where I don't have to tweak the EQ (that much) is B&O, Sennheiser, Monolith, Master & Dynamic, Audeze, and Grado.Battery: B&O claims a 35-hour battery with ANC n and a few more hours with it off. That's incredible and it's true so far. I'm very impressed with the battery.Connection: You can connect through BT or with a wire. Now, this is the one downside to these headphones. When you use the cable, you HAVE to turn the headphones on to hear audio. If I'm wrong, someone please correct me. I'm not going to deduct a star because it doesn't play a huge part to me.- The 5.1 BT connection is solid and doesn't break the connection when my phone is in my pocket or when I'm 2 floors down and left my phone on the third floor.Noise Cancelation: I've owned a pair of H9 3rd Gens and ever since owning those, I've always thought why B&O isn't taken seriously when comparing ANC to say Sony or Bose, the kings.- Let's say ANC is a 10/10 on both Sony and Bose, the HXs are a 9.5/10. Same with the 3rd Gens from what I remember.I'll say it again, I love the HXs. B&O delivers another worthy, beautiful product.

R3CWHO44RWT8J3,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars Best all in one package for on the go listening,Claire Chiang,5,"I wouldn’t exactly consider myself an audiophile when I see how hard core some real audiophiles are. I’m not super knowledgeable on the technical side and don’t have a seemingly bottomless budget to spend on owning a wide variety of equipment. However, I do care very much about enjoying my music at the highest level of detail possible.You know the feeling you get when you invest hours into research looking for the optimal product, the product finally arrives in a package at your house, and it really is as great as you were hoping for? That’s the feeling I had the first time I tried on my new Beoplay HX’s. My goal was to find the best sounding headphones to wear out in public, whether it’s for traveling or doing work at a coffee shop or library. And I have finally found the best product for myself. I have owned multiple pairs of headphones from the Bose QC line and the Sony XM line that I used to use for this purpose. But then I spoiled myself by listening to my Sennheiser HD 660S at home too much, and Bose and Sony no longer sounded good enough for me to enjoy my music.Sound quality:Like I was saying, my primary draw to these was that I was looking for the best sound quality possible for a pair of headphones of this class. Technically, the H95 would probably be better if I like these, but they were not on my list of considerations because I was not willing to pay the $850 price tag. In terms of level of enjoyment of music, the HX’s beat all similar noise cancelling headphones I have tried, including all Bose and Sony and other Beoplay headphones. Tight and clear bass which I like, good mids, and enough treble without the fatigue. I have always had a strong dislike for fatiguing treble, because it’s tricky to get the right balance of hearing the treble well but being able to tolerate long listening sessions without the fatigue. These do an excellent job of getting the right balance.Noise cancelling:These are not best in class for noise cancelling, but they fit my standard of “good enough”. And honestly, they’re really not significantly worse than best in class. I did a side by side comparison with my Sony XM3 while playing simulated engine and coffee shop noise from a third device. And while the XM3’s did do better, I could only tell the difference with music off. With music playing, the two pairs felt similar. My standard of “good enough” means that when I’m in a noisy environment, I can enjoy my music with most of the details without needing to blast the volume. At most, I would want the volume to be one notch higher than I would keep it at home in a quiet environment. These definitely get the job done for these intents and purposes.I have also owned the H9 3rd generation and tried the Beoplay Portal, and the HX’s, at least to my ears, beat both by a decent margin. Compared to the H9 3rd, these are better in that the bass is tighter and more refined, and there’s more sparkle or clarity in the mids and treble. I read from multiple sources that the Portals were supposed to have the same drivers as the HX’s, but they don’t sound the same at all. I purchased a pair of Portals to replace my H9’s and was sorely disappointed when I tried them on. My logic was that if HX’s and Portals were really that similar, I might as well have the gaming headset option even if I don’t game that often, but they are definitely not the same in sound. I felt like the Portals were more detailed than the H9 3rd generations, but music just wasn’t enjoyable for reasons I can’t completely articulate because my technical knowledge is limited. It may have to do with the way they were tuned, in that they were designed with less of a focus on being musical and more about hearing your game environment.Comfort:In regards to comfort, the things I look for are that whey I lie down, they don’t slip off my head, ears don’t touch inside of earcup, and that I can wear them for a long period of time without uncomfortable pressure or heat in my ears. These definitely fit the criteria I listed. One of my complaints about the Sony XM series was that they would slip down the back of my head when I wanted to lie down with them due to the weight distribution. The Bose QC series were good about not having that problem. The H9 3rd gen that I owned slipped occasionally. I haven’t had much of a problem with these. Also no problem with my ears touching the inside of the earcups, which was another gripe I had with the Sony XM series.Style/design:If I’m going to be wearing my headphones in public, style or design does matter. And in my opinion, these were designed with looks in mind. In my opinion, better looking than the Sony XM series by far, still better looking than the Bose QC series, and the only competitor comparable in style is probably the Bose 700 (which don’t sound good at all). It is worth noting that these don’t collapse, so they do take up more room in my backpack compared to most competitors. But that’s a relatively small tradeoff I’m willing to make if I love the overall package.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2021",AH6UE6F2UWY6WJ7VDGA3OL44LNEA,False,6,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R1KICATQR8R082,B08YJ3W1HB,2.0 out of 5 stars SOMETHING TO BE CONCERNED BEFORE YOU MAKE THE PURCHASE,gimbal,2,"I’ve been a Bang & Olufsen loyalist for years. I own a number of their audio products. The issue I’m having is with their new H9 replacement, Beoplay HX. The touch control is non-responsive to volume control. I’ve owned every generation of the H9 line, RMA’d an H9 3rd Gen previous to the HX, with a defective Bluetooth module.I bought the Beoplay HX days after its release. The unit arrived 5 days from the date of purchase. I was rather disappointed it arrived defective, especially after a previous RMA on an H9 3rd Gen. barely 2 months ago. Also, the noise cancellation doesn't even match the H9, there's leakage into the headphones from the surroundings, or the technology has been degraded in this model. At this rate, quality control is rather concerning compared to previous models. I want to purchase the E8 3rd Gen Sport for the gym but I have decided to hold off, or maybe go with something like Sennheiser or Bose.To put my hardware engineering hat on, in my opinion, the circular swipe design lends itself to problems because of the large capacitive touch area. They call it intuitive but it just doesn’t work as reasonably expected. It’s not flawless like Bose’s even on a good unit. This is my biggest knock on most modern B&O headphones with this volume control mechanism. I’m not sure why B&O insists on these awkward mechanics. I believe Bose is fairly successful in this area because their capacitive swipe is quite smooth and fairly accurate (I’ve owned all models of Bose headphones as well). On the Bose NC 700, to increase the volume, hold and swipe up. To decrease the volume, hold and swipe down. This in my opinion is more intuitive.The HX was the first purchase from the B&O website, I’ve made other purchases on Amazon and their boutique stores around the world. Obtaining an RMA on the online purchase was not an issue, it was a fairly easy process. I take issue with the non-sensical return process. After shelling $500 for a pair of headphones that arrived defective to no fault of mine, I don’t want to wait for another 40 to 50 days to get my hands on another pair. The 30 days free return on the website is misleading at best. It’s really lacking in details to account for this long return process. You don’t get a refund for another 2 to 3 weeks after they receive the defective unit. No matter if it’s the 30 days free return advertised on their website or return for replacement, the return shipping label from the company, in either case, is UPS ground, which could take up to a week to reach their warehouse. Adding to the 2 to 3 weeks RMA return process I mentioned, when all said and done, expect the return and refund process to take a month before you see your money. If you plan to re-purchase another unit, adds another 4 days to 5 days to received the unit. Expect 5 weeks to enjoy your Beoplay HX if you receive a defective unit. I can successfully RMA a Bose product and have my money back in less than a week. The big question becomes, why wait this long if returns are free as advertised? Logic dictates one should get a refund when they receive the unit and verify contents, a process that shouldn’t take more than 48 hours to be charitable. In my opinion, they should add the language “Allow 4 to 6 weeks for free return or RMA,” to be accurate.Alternatively, you can fork more cash to purchase another unit with the hope you will get a refund on the defective unit; that’s a $1,000 opportunity cost to you and cash-at-hand for B&O. If this sounds like a Ponzi scheme, that is my concern. And the story doesn’t end there. The surprise came when I tried to air my concerns to a supervisor or manager. They don’t exist… Similar to the Chinese model of customer service, the support staff you speak to on the phone is the end of the line. They don’t even have anyone to call you back. Per the support team call line, supervisors or managers don’t exist. If support can’t address your issue, you’re SOL!… If I’m purchasing a premium pair of headphones, I expect commensurate customer service. Companies selling $50 headphones have supervisors who can address concerns beyond the support staff level. This is the reason I referred to this manner of doing business as akin to a Ponzi Scheme—everything about the B&O decision-making chain is opaque. This business model appears to be ""TRUST US"", like the majority of Chinese manufacturers. Trust comes with transparency. If you don’t have a front-facing supervisory staff and want to sell consumers, then this is a major problem. Most consumers like to know concerns are being addressed by management should the need arise to escalate an issue. B&O generally makes good products but my online experience has been an eye-opener. In my opinion, they need to be more responsive to customers' concerns, especially if one is to spend a premium on their headphones. I’m not sure they appreciate there is a healthy level of competition with many reputable electronic makers coming on board to get a piece of this rapidly growing pie.From my experience, Bose is a level above the rest when it comes to their RMA process. Even though the return is ground, your exchange is ready to go as soon as UPS scans the return. You can receive an exchange for a defective unit in as little as 3 days from the time you request an RMA. Depending on how fast you need your headphones, shipping on the replacement unit can be upgraded as a courtesy to UPS 2nd Day Air. Compare that with 5 to 6 weeks for B&O. Plus, you can escalate your concerns to the level you wish, they are available to address your concerns. If they make a mistake with their order process, you get a free upgrade or sometimes free headphones. Bose has the best customer service experience in my book when it comes to consumer headphones. That’s what I expect from a premium headphone maker.UPDATE: 4-22-21 - Thoughts After Purchasing the 2nd Headset in Lieu of Waiting For RMA Process to Complete:I went with my option B and bought another pair of headphones while waiting for the previous set to get RMA'd for a full refund hopefully. The problem I stated, with my first headsets--non-responsive volume control swipe--still persists. In my opinion, this is most likely a hardware flaw or a bad production batch. You can't have two different headsets bought at different time periods exhibiting the exact same problem. I'm comparing it to the smooth mechanics of the Beoplay H9 series. I found however that if you press on the control area with a moderate-to-high amount of pressure, it works somewhat, but is far from accurate, or even an ideal solution. This is something Bang & Olufsen engineers may have to address. I'm not sure if this can be done through a firmware update. If it's adjusting sensitivity, this can be done... I like the headphones, the earcups are slighting larger, the sound signature is what you expect from B&O, and the carrying case is finally commensurate with premium headphones. But I'm disappointed with the ANC. It is not as good as the H9, which was not as effective as say Bose NC 700. I will keep them for the 30-day grace period and see if I can live with this big inconvenience if no proposed hardware remedies. If anything changes, I will be sure to provide an update.UPDATE: 4-24-21: Battery LifeWOW!!!... The battery life on these headphones is truly amazing, I just had to share this update.I decided to put together my Summer tracks. I couldn't believe the battery life on these headphones. They last over 48 hours of continuous heavy music listening, with ANC on, at about 80% volume, and still had 20% battery remaining!! I haven't experienced any premium headphones out there with such juice. You have to move into custom $1,000 plus headphones. Battery life is truly phenomenal, better than advertised in this experience!! Bose NC 700 are ready to quit after less than 24 hours of continuous listening with ANC on. Sony MX1000's go a little longer but nothing compared to the B&O HXs. This is a big positive if you travel frequently.","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2021",AGZ6OFEP6AH4EN2L4OKSFNTAVCEA,False,34,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1BH8ZWT0J9FU,B08YJ3W1HB,"5.0 out of 5 stars Premium design, beautiful sounding, comfortable, decent but not spectacular noise cancellation",Mahajo,5,"I’ve been wanting to try Bang & Olufsen headphones for sometime but the H95’s were just too much $$$ for me to justify the expense. However the newer HX’s were a $100 off their regular price so I decided now was the time to try them. I have tried numerous wireless noise canceling headphones over the last year and really liked a number of them but none were exactly right for one reason or another. I tried Sennheiser Momentum 3’s, Bowers & Wilkins PX7’s, Master and Dynamics MW65’s, Shure Aionic 50’s and still own the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and the AirPods Max. In my opinion the Bang & Olufsen HX’s are the best of the lot, overall, but aren’t perfect by any means but are very close. Longer battery life, excellent sound especially when tweaked with the equalizer in the Bang & Olufsen app and are super comfortable for extended wear. Noise cancelling is very good, not Sony level but close. To my ears sound better than the AirPods Max and so much lighter and more comfortable. One note on comfort is yes, the round ear cups are smaller then the rectanglular shape of the AirPods Max and will probably sit a little on your ears as they do mine, however the leather covered memory foam ear pads combined with the light but stable clamping force of these headphones make it a non issue. After 3+ hours of wear I was only minimally aware of them, they are that comfortable. They have a wear detection feature but I found even on the reduced setting it would pause music with the slightest turn of my head so I turned it off. I read longer hair (I do need a hair cut) can cause issues and a recalibration can fix it but it’s not that important to me at this time. As for the only other issue that will bother some is the touch controls are finicky for sure, the play, pause and swipe to change tracks works fine but the volume swipe around the cup is very difficult to get to work, at least for me it has been, but still not that big of a deal to me. I love the sand color with the gold accented aluminum finish on the cups which is eye-catching for sure. Only had them for less than 24 hours so can’t really speak about battery life as of yet but seems to be on par with what Bang & Olufsen claim. Sound quality is top-notch with a well balanced sound the you can adjust in the app to what you like. Bass is precise and pleasant, especially on the warmer side of the eq but not overpowering like some. It hits the sweet spot for me. Over-all these are my favorite headphones yet and I highly recommend them especially at the Black Friday prices! I may update later as I use them more and after I use them outside of the apartment. I’m a headphone addict I guess and I love these headphones!11/28/21 Update. The wear sensors work great as long as you calibrate them first: have the headphones on a flat surface, turn them on, turn in the wear sensors and then put them on. Once calibrated they work perfectly. I do recommend the “reduced sensitivity “ setting. Also the volume slider works fine as long as you are swiping in the right spot inside the ring on the right ear cup. Battery life is as advertised! Love them!Update 12/16/21: Sadly, I decided to return these headphones for a couple of reasons: noise cancelling was not very strong and didn’t really block out much noise (especially on the bus commuting to work). The wear sensors worked when calibrated every time you turn on the headphones but when I had them connected to both my iPhone and iPad Pro they would always auto play music from my iPad no matter what I had been listening to prior to turning them on/off. Also the sound was very finicky, they sounded great for instrumental and jazz but other genres weren’t as great with either sharp highs or the bass would distort at higher volumes (even after the software update was supposed to fix this issue). I was constantly having to adjust the EQ to find a good sound that wouldn’t sound great across all songs. I really wanted to love them because of the premium design, materials and good looks, but in the end decided they weren’t worth the high price. Went back to the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and am happy with my decision (strong sound and excellent noise cancellation).Update Again, 2/16/22. After purchasing and liking Shure’s Aonic 40 headphones, but not satisfied with their build quality, I couldn’t resist purchasing the B & O Beoplay HX (this time in Black Anthracite) again and I’m so happy I did. (What was I thinking returning them?) the build quality is first rate, super comfortable (despite the round ear cups which do sit on my ears a bit, but are soft and really comfortable even for long periods) and the sound quality is the best over all that I’ve tested. I wasn’t impressed the first time with the noise cancellation but upon this second listen realize it is better than I gave it credit for and slightly better than than the noise cancellation on the Shure’s. Once you find the right spot on the unusual eq in the app the sound is kind of unparalleled. The only issues I have found is the wear sensors don’t always work so I turned them off, and the multi-point connection causes some unwanted functions like automatically playing from my iPad Pro even if I was listening on my iPhone last time they were connected. (Auto play not an issue with the sensors turned off anyway). Also, the touch controls are finicky but I’ve found most are. Not deal breakers for me. I revised my rating and now highly recommend the HX, particularly at a discounted price (they are pricey, but you get what you pay for, as they say!)","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2021",AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,True,33,Color: SandSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
