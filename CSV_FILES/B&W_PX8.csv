R1192BYGQG4BDU,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sound and comfort makes them worth the high asking price,JD,5,"I have spent months (years, really) of research searching for the perfect set of no-compromise, best-at-everything bluetooth ANC headphones at any price. I've bought and ended up returning a couple sets that each disappointed in some way or another, and had essentially given up on such a headset ever existing. My priorities are (in order): - Sound (including high-bitrate bluetooth codecs because I prefer to listen wirelessly) - Comfort (especially over many hours on long flights) - Active Noise Canceling (ANC) - Call quality - Quality-of-life features (I like buttons, though I know some prefer touch controls)The recent wave of ultra-premium headphones (Focal Bathys, B&W PX8, M&D MW75, Mark Levinson No. 5909, B&O Beoplay H95, etc.) got my hopes up, and while I don't think any of them truly hit that ""no compromise"" standard, the PX8 from Bowers & Wilkins came *very* close, and for me is the best on the market at any price (as of fall 2022).~~~Sound~~~First and foremost, they sound incredible. My wife has the Sony WH-1000XM5's and while those sound great (significantly better than their Bose counterparts, imho), the PX8's blow them out of the water on clarity and separation. I won't try to write up a full audiophile description of the sound because there are plenty of more qualified ones online, but I will give an anecdote: without telling her which headphones or their price tag, I put these on my wife's head and played a song she loves and has heard many times (instrumental metal, if that matters). She listened quietly and said ""It sounds like I'm hearing this song for the first time.""Also important to me is the fact that the sound is on the warm side and easy to listen to for extended periods. I am sensitive to high-frequency sound and often have problems with sibilance or a ""sharp"" quality to high end audio equipment that strives for upper range extension. These have plenty of detail in the highs, but none of that sharp quality that I personally find irritating.~~~Comfort~~~The other area that the B&W PX8's really shine is on comfort. I have big ears that stick out a lot, and many over-ear headphones press my ears down in a way that gets uncomfortable. My wife's Sony XM5's are a great example - because they have such stellar ANC I like to borrow them for flights, but I can only wear them for a couple hours before my ears get physically sore. The PX8's have no such problem. They have large earcups, and the angled drivers create a deep space in the back that gently cradles even my Dumbo-esque ears. I keep finding excuses to wear them, because they just feel so good.~~~Active Noise Cancelling~~~This is why I say they aren't truly ""no compromise"" headphones. The passive noise blocking is quite good, and the ANC is effective at cutting down outside sound, but it isn't class-leading. The Sony XM5's, Bose QC45's, and Apple Airpods Max all seem to do a better job of creating that total Cone of Silence I crave on long flights. This is a common trend among the most premium audiophile headphones though, and some companies have said that there are engineering trade-offs that have to be made between sound quality and ANC. I'm not sure I'm totally sold on that narrative, but if slightly weaker ANC is the price of this glorious sound quality, then that's an acceptable trade in my book.~~~Call Quality~~~Very good, my voice can be heard clearly. Not quite as good at blocking out background sounds as the Sony XM5's or my Jabra headset with a boom mic, but perfectly adequate for the situations I need.~~~Features~~~I love the well-made buttons (I live in a cold weather climate where touch controls are less than ideal), and the app is refreshingly simple. It doesn't have some bells and whistles (no adjustable ANC, limited EQ options, no voice detection or automatic situational awareness), but it has what I need and works well. The only exception here is on-ear detection, which is finicky and frequently pauses the music even on ""low"" so I had to turn it off. It's not a must-have feature for me but might be more bothersome for some.Edit: another issue I have noticed after a couple weeks of use is that the ""skip backward"" function doesn't work very well. In theory you can skip backward with a triple-press of the multifunction button, which I do often when I want to go back a few seconds in a podcast, but 80% of the time it either skips forward or pauses instead. Not a huge deal, but annoying.~~~Summary~~~Best-sounding, most comfortable bluetooth ANC headphones I have ever tried. Other features aren't necessarily the best among the competition - in particular I wouldn't mind having stronger, adjustable ANC - but they are more than good enough, and all together I think the package justifies the high price.","Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2022",AFN2EZ7N6BTU2AC46T4DIF5S4JAQ,True,133,Color: Black
R3H8WCKL01KGN9,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Superb detail and clarity. Excellent build quality,BigGinge,5,"I was growing frustrated with my Sony WH-1000XM4/5's constantly losing their settings (randomly enabling Speak-to-Chat was particularly annoying, so though I'd try the B&W Px8'sThe Px8's might not have the touch/swipe gesture features of the Sony (which I suspect was the cause of many of my issues with the WH-1000XMx's), but this is a very minor gripe and the button controls for volume/pause/next /previous etc. work very well.Sound quality is on another level when compared to my Sony's. Clarity and detail is fantastic and I'm hearing new detail in recordings I have been listening to for years. I've also compared to my Sennheiser Momentum (wired / no-noise cancelling) and Momentum 4 (wireless / noise cancelling) and the difference is just as stunning. The Sony may have more features and tech (360 sound, ear shape analysis etc.) than the Px8, but where the Sony relies on its tech to enhance audio, the Px8's rely on higher quality components and less ""processing"".Build quality is also superb. These are easily the best built headphones I've owned. Top quality materials make these extremely tactile. They feel slightly heavier than the Sony's in my hand, but they are far more comfortable to wear.My ears would feel ""pressure"" when using the Sony's for extended periods of time. I do not get that the the Px8's.Despite the gripes I had with the Sony's I would have recommended them to anyone looking for a decent paid of noise cancelling headphones. Since getting the Px8's, I'd suggest spending / saving a little more and getting the PX8's or even consider the PX7's which have a similar construction/sound.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AE7TFCX7HWKKUCNMKUWHNC7DGB7Q,True,1,Color: Black
R37L2Z72FO4L3G,B0B349KKSV,"1.0 out of 5 stars No warranty, no support, torn headband",Paul H. Anderson,1,"I wanted 2 things from my headphones. First, the quality of the sound. Music needs to be deep, rich, balanced, with a nice presence. Secondly, they needed to be comfortable. These headphones rated high in both areas. Now that I've used it for about a month, I can say it really delivers in both areas. I'm glad I have it.You'll notice I didn't mention noise reduction. I don't need that, working from home. I don't ride public transportation, so I don't need noise reduction. I've tried it and found it to be acceptable. It will fit my needs on the occasional times. I've read others are better, but I bought these headphones to listen to music, not silence. And they are great for that.I've heard that the speakers needed to be broken in. That is true. Right out of the box, the sound is okay, but not worth the dollars. So I connected my phone, set it aside, and let it play all day. Every so often I would listen to see how it was going. Every time I listened, it sounded better. After about 8 -9 hours of play, I pretty much got the sound I had paid for. It improved a little after that, so they sound great now. If you buy these, be sure to give it time for the speakers to reach their peak. You won't be sorry.**********Follow up after 9 month's use:After less than a year's use, the cushion on the headband pulled out as seen by the photo. Since the headphones were supposed to have a 2 year warranty, I contacted B&W for help. They told me that because of who I purchased the headphones from, they would not honor the warranty or help me. They told me to contact the seller. I sent the seller an email, but never got a reply.Yes, the headphones sound great. But for the amount paid, the quality of the construction is very lacking, to wear out after less than a year. Worse, despite what B&W says, there is NO warranty and NO support from the manufacturer. They simply won't stand behind their product, as my experience and their comments show. This is inexcusable for a company with their supposed reputation and for the high cost of the headphones. I strongly suggest you search elsewhere for a better built product from a company that will stand behind their products.","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2023",AEKE54FRSPNDPL7KKIQ6MYPVXLLQ,True,55,Color: Tan
R3N0NRYLQ62UOG,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sound but not perfect,Aaron S,5,"My headphones arrived in new condition and were as expected for a new product. They came charged at 50 percent and it took about 45 minutes to charge to 100 percent. The most important thing to review is the audio quality, and I can tell you that the audio is crisp and punchy as you would expect from Bowers & Wilkins. Trebles are excellent. Bass is a bit muddy especially on older recordings and could use some improvement. Overall, these are good enough to go ahead and sell my AirPods Max.What I do not like, is the wear sensor. Even on the lowest sensitivity, it causes music to randomly pause. This is very disappointing and for 700 dollars this should not be a problem. I decided to turn the wear sensor feature off, as it is useless. Comfort on my head is good, and wearing long-term they are very comfortable. I do have the experience of the headphones sliding around on my head when bending over or moving slightly, and this seems to have to do with the shape of the headband and how it rests on the head. This needs improving but is not a deal breaker.Vocals sound especially good, and instrumentation, especially jazz sounds incredible. Percussion parts sound just ok, but I would like those frequencies to have more presence. As I mentioned before bass sounds a bit muddy and I was able to improve it by adjusting the iPhone EQ settings and the bass setting in the B&W music app.I totally recommend these headphones. I am very pleased with my purchase, and I can't stop listening to my music collection all over again and hearing it in a new way. Addicting sound.I am very pleased with my purchase.UPDATE: The issue with the wear sensor being too sensitive has been resolved with a firmware update.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AET5VCKVEYIUNFVEKNXECOIDLHEA,True,19,Color: Black
R2LPNJL3WGT49E,B0B349KKSV,3.0 out of 5 stars Great If you know what to expect,Ring ding,3,"I purchased these anticipating that they were going to replace my open backs the Hifiman Sundaras and my AirPod pro 2S. Something with such a luxurious sound that none of my headphones would be able to compete. But the px8s are far from that. To get my actual issue out of the way, the apps battery life report is useless and inaccurate. It said the headphones were at 37% then a few seconds later, 15% then 0% all within a minute. After a full recharge and only trusting the Apple widget the battery life tracked just fine. So I believe the head phones were fine it was just the app. Now to sound quality. I was shocked to hear that no joke my AirPods have more bass than these closed back headphones. Don’t get me wrong the px8s are super clear and have great treble, imaging, and decent mids. But without any real low end even after EQ they are lackluster. It really leaves a sense to music that it’s just straight up missing something the soul of the song is gone. That may be I’m just open back spoiled. But there were many times I thought to myself wow I’d actually enjoy this more in my AirPods, and which I did. If you like very technical sounding headphones with little bass, then these will do it for you all the way since the detail is simply amazing. But if you want something that can be a do it all headphone these are not it. I recently demoed some HIFIMAN EDITION XS’s and they actually sound pretty much exactly what I wanted the PX8s to sound like. Sound so good you set through music you’d never listen to because the quality of the sound makes any genre and song intresting to listen too. From bass to treble the edition XS’s do it all beautifully and are cheaper than the px8s!!!!!! Yes they are 2 completely different headphones, one for on the go, and ones just made for home. But if your in the search for the best headphones, and thought because they’re B&Ws they had to be amazing, I just have to let you know these are not it. I know you can’t really demo these things anywhere, and reviews on YouTube are all over the place in the comments. But all I gotta say all the “negative” comments in reviews of the PX8s are true. I also forgot to mention but with ANC and pass through, when I turned my head they would make this very high pitched noise, even after updating them to the newest firmware they continued to have a weird high pitch feedback when turning you head with ANC or Passthrough on. But yeah that’s my review. I’m only being harsh because they’re pricey! $700 new on their website. With what I experienced and listed to, wired to a dac on my pc and Bluetooth, I would have kept them if they were $200.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023",AFB6R6B3XN2XS6V4OO6UISXTWCPA,True,11,Color: Black
R1JD8F8TV02AJZ,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars I really didn’t like them at first!,PiperFlyer,4,"When you spend a bunch of money on something and don’t like it out of the box, you get that sick feeling of disappointment in your stomach. The box arrived and I was super excited. The quality of the packaging, the smell of the of leather, the quality heft of the build material…oh, this was going to be great! When I linked them using the lossless cord set up and started to listen…dead…flat…boring…DISAPPOINTING! I messed with he EQ, pushing the settings to extremes and back. I quickly grabbed my Sony XM4s, then my AirPod Max and even my old Beats Studio 3 for comparison. ALL SOUNDED BETTER…ALL of the them! Even my ragged out Beats! The the hell? I went straight for break in mode. I hooked them up to an old iPhone that I converted to an iPod and set up a play list of big bass Megan Trainer, Bruce Springsteen “Jungleland” for the screaming highs of Clarence’s sax (sadness filled me as I remembered his passing), Gran Bel Fisher’s “So, Wildly” for some rest. I added some INXS, Bleachers and “The Smile has Left Your Eyes” but Asia. Man, that song has a lot going on in it! Then, I let them run for a whole battery cycle. I let them rest and charge for a few hours the then tan them another…then another…then another. Okay, now we are getting somewhere.After some serious break in time, they are really starting to sound really, really good.My assessment is this. When you build a headphone set like Sony, that are designed to sound good out of the box and deliver slightly sloppy bass, you don’t need to really break them in much. But if you buy something that is built to replicate sound with more precision, you’ve to to build them a little better and they may need to break in. As these are breaking in, I’m backing down the treble and bass and I’m starting to hear some of the musical instrument separation and sound stage that some reviewers mention.Losses vs Bluetooth. Yeah, they sound better wired to my MacBook or iPad and that’s a great way to listen to them but that is not a practical way to live with them. Does that make sense? When I want to really enjoy some HQ Lossless music, I stop down and listen but this morning I did some housework and they sound really good over Bluetooth. They are a little heave compared to Sonys but not too bad.ANC. Not as good as Sony nor AirPod Max but a close third. Very close and interestingly, better than Bose QC45s.Comfort. Not as good as Sony or Bose or my Philips open backs. About the same as AirPod Max. Way better than Beats Studio Pro.Weight. Kinda heavy feeling. Similar to my AirPod Max but the AirPods distribute the weight much better. After wearing these for an hour or so then putting on my XM4s, the Sony’s feel crazy light!!Sound. Balanced compared to the treble heavy AirPod Max, balanced. Compared to the heavier bass of the Sony’s mellow and smoooth. Compared to open backs, focused and deliberate. Compared to Beats Studio Pro…well a lot sounds better then Beats (but I like my Beats). Non-music audio. Awesome! I stream shows and football games and Formula1 races over my AppleTV or iPad and spoken audio sounds so much better on the PX8 than most of headphones I own. The Sony’s are boomy, the Beats sound muffled in comparison. The AirPods Max are the only ones that sound as good and maybe a tad better.WEB REVIEWERS!! That’s another thing. How can someone on YouTube pull a set like these out of the box and give an accurate review? They can’t! Use Caution when listening to them unless they clearly talk about break in.In closing, as The Beach Boys Sloop John B plays in my ears, I have gone from having my finger on the return button to gripping them tightly in my 54-year-old hands. These really are great and a wonderful addition to my growing collections of headphones.","Reviewed in the United States September 23, 2023",AGXYBAI6TANWRZ2Z3K2AJ6REMICQ,True,33,Color: Black

RZVJYEV2CN7QR,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound Quality for Wireless Headphone. Period!,ND,5,"I am an audiophile and have owned Sennheisers, various Bowers & Wilkins PX series headphones including the latest PX7 S2. From a travel standpoint I have owned all the last four Bose headphones - QC 25, QC 35, QC 35 II & NC 700. I have been searching for a headphone that is comfortable for travel, exceptional sound quality and good noise cancelation... in this order of priority. The Bowers Wilkins PX8 fits this three criteria perfectly. Sound quality - it is fast, drum beats reverberate naturally and sound astoundingly real... the speed of the carbon drivers are unreal, you have to hear it to believe it - the frequencies decay so fast... nothing trips up carbon driver of the PX8 - metal, symphony, dance, deep bass music - I have tried various genres over the last two weeks to see if there is some kind of music that will trip up this headphone and have found none... this is the only headphone that I have owned where I look forward to wearing it everyday when I take the dog for a walk and it is like carrying your stereo listening room right around your head. The sound stage, placement of instruments, and overall sound quality is just astounding. Noise canceling is not as good as Bose; I'd rate it 3/5 for noise canceling as tested on a plane. The pass through & aware features are very nicely implemented. It is comfortable because of the nappa leather, the PX7 S2 which is the exact same design was not as comfortable because of synthetic surface, but nappa leather PX8 makes a massive difference in terms of comfort. After four hours of flying the PX8 was still supremely comfortable with no pressure points on the top of the head. If you like sound reproduction that makes you want to listen to music over and over and tap your feet to the music and enjoy the emotion of music... this is the only headphone that delivers it all - comfort, noise canceling and just astounding sound reproduction. If you not into sound quality or an audiophile, I'd recommend getting the Bose QC 35 II. But if you are an audiophile that is looking for exceptional sound quality, the Bower Wilkins PX8 with its amazingly fast carbon driver is the epitome of wireless headphone for sound quality - period... full stop... the end... as audiophiles would say, this is a 'musical' headphone; you have to hear it to believe it.... 100% worth it for $700. Simply a brilliant product by Bowers & Wilkins, and I can see why Bowers & Wilkins believes that they can charge $700 for it; because it really is that amazing.... no exaggeration.

The EQ adjustment is very good. It’s dead silent. They are very comfortable and I have big ears. The pass through is good. The problem there, though, is if you lean on the back of either ear it makes a sort of white noise so resting your head and turning it isn’t ideal. The noise canceling is good.It’s just the app that sucks. It disconnects. It takes time to connect when it should connect automatically when the phones are on. The volume level of the spoken voice telling you it’s connected or disconnected is WAY TOO LOUD. There are times when you have to reconnect the phones seemingly for no reason.

R37JRBEZZ9FTV3,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it worth it?,XStar-Infinity,4,"It truly depends what genres you listen to. I've been using the Sony Xm5's for the past 3 weeks using an iPhone. Today I got the Px8's delivered and I wanted to test them out on both iPhone and with an Aptx HD device so i went and bought another phone that supported it. The one thing that stood out immediately to me is that music from the Px8's don't have the spacial 3D sound effect that the Sony's do. On both the Aptx Hd device and the iPhone they both had the same style of sound just somewhat more enhanced on the Aptx HD of course. I personally listen to Hip Hop/ Rap the most and to be honest, I genuinely like the Sony Xm5's better because of the Spacial 3D Reality audio effects. How would that sound descriptively? The best way I can put it is that the audio in the Sonys sound more like your listening to music from a speaker outside of you but with very clear detail how as the Px8's just hit you directly with the sound. I feel pulled into the music listening to the Sony's how as I feel hit by the music through the Px8s. This has been my experience listening to Hip/Hop Rap music. I did tune to Rock and a couple other genre's and there is beautifully sounded music that includes actual instruments, but still not 3D spacial audio effects that's vital for me personally.As far as the build and comfort go, THe Px8's dominate the build as they feel very professionally designed compared to the more plastic material from the Sonys. When it comes to comfort, they are both equally comfortable in two different ways. The Sony's are loser whilst the Px8s are more snug, but both feel comfortable. I would probably say the Px8's feel better to wear but if you like the earphones being looser around the ears, the Sony's are that.I would say if you don't mind audio not having more of a 3D feeling to them, then these may be worth it. I'll also mention, the Px8's had a more clear vocal sound and sounded like the artist was closer to you than the Sonys did.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2022",AHZMS5IHZYE6OPXSFS2L4ZL6D6TQ,True,38,Color: Black

I also own the Px7 S2 headphones, which are also great. The Px8’s are better, definitely, but the differences are subtle. Is it worth the extra $300? That depends I guess. Once I tried the Px8’s it was difficult to go back the Px7 S2. The sound is more refined and detailed and the build quality, with the aluminum and Napa leather making them even more comfortable. Also, a recent update on the Bowers & Wilkins app fixed the performance of the wear sensors on both sets so the auto-pause/play now works exactly as it should. These are the most comfortable, best sounding headphones I currently own (including the Sony WH-1000XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4, the Bang & Olufsen H95 and the aforementioned Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2’s. My only complaint is with the noise cancellation, I really wish it was stronger and also the bass can distort a bit at high volumes on some tracks and I can’t increase the bass level more than a notch or it becomes an issue, but overall the bass sounds fine (if you like bass I recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones, the bass is thumping!). Now if these were lower priced, say $549-$599 I think it would be fully a recommendation I could make without any doubts. But at $699 it’s a tougher sell. If you are reluctant to spend that much, wait for a sale or go for the lower priced Px7 S2 headphones, those are a better value. But if you want the best, then go for the PX8’s. I think they will prove their worth in the long run! They are simply gorgeous headphones!

But when I put them on and went through the usual test tracks, I kind of regretted spending so much on something that sounds just kind of ""meh"".So, I put them in the living room to listen to the TV when I wake up early to not bother anyone sleeping figuring they would work great for that, even if a little overkill. A few months later, I decided to use them for music in the office for a few days just to see if the ANC would work well enough. I put on some music and wow! I could not believe how good they sounded!As mentioned in other reviews, it seems breaking in with this set is critical. Something I had gotten use to not doing with other headsets and ear buds. Go figure. But now I like them so much, I actually ordered a second pair while on sale for black Friday.For ANC, they are decent. Not as good as the B&O H95s I auditioned at their store in NYC - those have the best ANC I have probably ever heard. But the PX8s are still good enough for general office noise. And the H95 have a very narrow sound stage to the point it actually sounded a little left of center which I confirmed with another pair there - strange.Battery life is very good as well. I have never fully ran them down but have not really tried.So, ya, they are a great headset once ran in.

I bought the Sony XM4s, the Sony XM5s (earbuds and headphones), the AirPods Pro 2s, the AirPods Pro Max, the Bose QuietComfort, the Sennheiser HD660S2 (these along with an amplifier came closest to the PX8s), and various other cheaper Skullcandy earbuds. The PX8s are amazing. RICH bass without being overbearing. Perfect when syncing it up with the TV or PC, but you can’t appreciate their full potential if you use them with a phone that has an inherent sound limiter. They are LOUD and clear with no distortion even at max volume. I have a ~2500w sound system in my car with all the bells and whistles and these headphones seriously remind me of that. They also are extremely easy to sync with any device as it’s recognizable immediately. I have no negatives to complain about.

RDW2WJWVPBYEY,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars On the fence on sound; Bluetooth connectivity is useless.,Alex,4,"The sound of this unit deserves the plaudits it has received, but I'm not sure its audiophile quality. For this price, I'm still on the fence, although I'm considerably enjoying it.The Bluetooth connectivity is awful. It does not connect automatically to my iPhone or iPad. Even when connected, the app does not recognize the unit without prodding and fiddling, so it is not possible to apply the noise cancellation without effort.I think the noise cancellation of the unit has been understated by the reviews, although I take at face value that it is not as good as other headphones in this class. It does meet or exceed the strong cancellation on my airpods pro.Back to the sound -- I'm having trouble figuring out what works best. Over Bluetooth, the sound achieved by the three modes -- noise cancellation on, NC of, and passthrough mode -- is different. It seems like the ""off"" mode gets the worst sound, and the passthrough mode is best.For wired mode, I'm getting a bassy, boomy sound so far.The comfort of the unit is quite strong.The Bluetooth issues may be what pushes me over the edge in returning the unit. It's far worse that cheaper headphones I bought years ago. That it will not connect automatically to even one device is ludicrous.If this unit were $300, it would be a no-brainer despite the problems, and I guess I take the various YouTube videos at face value that the sound is best in class. But at this price point, it certainly deserves some scrutiny .","Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2022",AFQMOZJXXBMYETRNKH7UZV32NUMQ,True,21,Color: Black
R156JNPELR9P9F,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful luxurious sound,Pete Uballe,5,"Very impressed with the B&W PX8s. They look and feel incredibly well built. Beautiful to look at. I got the royal burgundy color. Gorgeous. Right out of the box, they sound is impressive. I would say the sound is also luxurious. They have a deep detailed texture with beautiful clarity. Listening to Michael Franks' ""The Sound In My Head"" and Diana Krall's ""Live In Paris"" was amazing. It was like I had never really heard those albums before.I had previously ordered the Focal Bathys. And they sound fantastic as well, but I had to return them. I believe the design of Focal's headband is seriously flawed. I own a pretty good sized collection of headphones from many different brands and the Bathys are the first headphones that have actually caused some serious pain to the top of my head. It brought on headaches and dizziness. And this is after wearing them for only 20 to 30 minutes. On the other hand, I have worn the PX8s for 2 to 3 hours at a time with no problems whatsoever.So, I'm very pleased with my purchase of the B&W PX8s.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2024",AHPZUSH25PE4Z4IRNMDU56N3DPXQ,True,5,Color: Royal Burgundy
RH98JS8TM3LBH,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely a Keeper,chchon,5,"I bought these to replace my Sennheiser PXC 550's, which were still working but seemed dated after six years. The Px8's are a noticeable improvement-particularly the sound, which is superior for a blue-tooth headphone. These produce great detail, balance and sound stage. I particularly enjoy how they bring vocalists to life (I listen to classical and jazz primarily). They also are most comfortable, with spacious ear cups and just the correct clamping force. All this noted, they are 100 grams heavier than my PXC 550's so I noticed the extra weight immediately.So what is my recommendation? If you can afford the extra for the luxury experience, go for it. If you are a daily commuter or student, who uses these on the go and need top-end phone functionality, go for the less-expensive and lighter Sony, Bose, Sennheiser options. The Px8s would be perfect on a cruise or an occasional airline trip, but less so for daily highly mobile usage.But if you want to kick back and enjoy a luxury experience at home or on an occasional trip, seriously consider these. I should note that I compared these to the highly regarded Focal Bathys blue tooth headphones. Indeed, the Focal Bathys are wonderful products, and they do present slightly better sound by audiophile standards (that is, clarity and sound stage). Yet the Px8's were more secure, comfortable, offer impressive clarity and sound stage, and generally provide a more pleasant presentation and listening experiences. In particular, the Focal's crystal-clear treble came off as harsh to me (and my wife and sister in law). So, headshape and ear sensitivity may lead to different conclusions among some, but the Px8's really hold their own among the very best wireless headphone experiences.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2023",AHK5TOIJMI3Q3REHZDIZUTGDZ5MQ,True,9,Color: Black

In digging into reviews, this is a common problem (design not problem).If you are into good sound and looking at the price point and Bluetooth calling isn’t important to you, these would be good.

I've owned the PX7 and the PX, (both sold) as well as the PX7 S2 (currently own). The PX8 is in a category of its own vs the other B&W headphones I've owned. I didn't buy it for the ANC though its more than adequate. I didn't buy it for phone conversations or web conferences either, though its more than adequate here as well. I bought it for the sound, the comfort, and the quality of the design and materials. Paired with a high res streaming source (I use Qobuz), and a device running Android and supporting the AptX adaptive bluetooth codec, (not that easy to find but they exist), I'm having a wonderful time of it exploring much of my favorite music all over again. It is stunning. The PX8 also works well with lossless streaming, a DAC and the USB C to USB C cable that's included when connected to my laptop. I've now winnowed down my headphone collection to the PX8 and the B&O H95. Both offer their own unique, quality listening experience.

As soon as I hit the road I knew these weren’t from me. With full NC on, standing in the boarding queue, I could hear the guy behind me crackling his plastic water bottle.

I bought the h95, which are an outstanding headphone, but for the money and quality, these are the way to go. The sound is v shaped with enhanced lows and highs. The mids are slightly wonky, unless EQ. The build quality, case and fit are top notch. These are not heavy on the head and with the slanted drivers, you get a nice sound stage. These are extremely comfortable and I can wear them for hours. The one thing I really want to press is the ANC. It’s out of this world good! It rivals any other highly rated ANC headphone. If you want high quality materials, outstanding audio, amazing ANC, and a slick look, these are the way to go!","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2024",AGAVLI2FGMZOBUCZYHMFGIMYTKAQ,False,0,Color: Black
