R1M1ZIK6WZ8AIK,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Low cost AirPods Max alternative! A classic revisited!,Mahajo,5,"My earliest forays into a More expensive headphone was with the Beats Brand and the wired Beats Pro headphones. Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!","Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2023",AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,True,344,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1MZVYL3ULXVYC,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars The King is back, for a niche audience",Apple nerd,5,"I loved my Beats Solo headphones as a teenager. I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic. I absolutely love these - and am so happy I got them!","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2023",AEUHSKBV2ADJTTXVB55RN7UQQZTA,True,359,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2TKWVR4L10Q0W,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good and an honest review,Jeffrey K.,5,"I bought my beats studio pros (blue) as my old Bose Headphones died. Bluetooth linked perfectly to my devices. There is some audio lag (latency) if watching video (similar to all other audio devices I've used). I personally love that it comes with a 3.5mm audio cord. I used that to watch video on my computer. It saves battery and with the cord there is no latency. Sometimes it is just nice to have a corded headphone. Without the cord, the bluetooth range is pretty good.Sound quality is very good and I am most impressed with its ability to do DOLBY ATMOS. Make sure the content you are listening to is formatted for ATMOS and that your phone/device has atmos turned on. It makes a big difference. Bass sounds good and deep but maybe a little less than expected for Beats. Volume turned up loud did not make crackling noises or become distorted. Battery lasts a decent amount and nice to recharge by USB (goodbye batteries!). Noise cancelling is pretty good too and with audio playing it gets rid of any outside noises.Some people complained about the comfort and their ears hurting. I have not experienced this. The ear pads are pretty soft and your ear (mine at least) fits INSIDE the padding verses ON my ear. I can wear for hours and have no issues.Overall a well made product that sounds great for $200 (Deal Price). I'm happy with it and my beats studio buds!","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AEKNOXKFYEIDCUI3EPV3XUTZPHBA,True,37,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3RSUGFYRCGKOF,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Good Quality.",Spazzola,5,"Well, after having lost one of my AirPods (gen3) and not being able to justify purchasing a replacement left pod for $90, I started doing research.I came across these beats studio pros and looked at their stats. 40 hours of play time? Probably the most enticing thing about them to me. Then came the active noise cancellation, and spatialized audio. ANC intrigued me. I wanted it to be better than the AirPods at cutting out sound. While I was looking into these I happened to be doing it during Black Friday deals. Which meant I thought they were $170, which was the price of brand new AirPods. Then I saw their original price of $350. Which enticed me even more in a way, thinking of the price tag fallacy, higher price must mean quality. I mulled this over and over and eventually ended up missing the half off sale. Then I knew I wanted these babies. I watched and waited for a sale to come up again. I was not willing to pay $350 for wireless headphones, as I am not willing to pay $350 on just about anything, but thats just me. For me, $179 is splurging significantly. I caught another sale. I bought them and hoped for the best.I will have to be honest in saying I was hesitant to stray from AirPods and move over to headphones. The less I have on me the better, so having something sit in my ear rather than over my head appeals to me. But having my device constantly slip out of my ear or feel unsecured was not enjoyable. That’s how I lost my left AirPod in the first place. These headphones feel sturdy for me. I was pleasantly surprised. Although I still did not particularly care for a bulkier heavier device, I did appreciate their securedness. They do eventually make my ears sore but I usually just adjust them. I will not count this against them because every pair of headphones I have ever owned eventually made my ears hurt or gave me a headache. Im sensitive what can I say? The padding on the top band that goes over your head was a nice touch.The ANC is powerful. I loved being immersed in my music. I have no complaints really.Spatial Audio… I personally could care less about it, so I don’t have much to say about it. I just don’t use it as a personal choice, not saying it isn’t good.The sound quality seems adequate to me.The volume is pretty great, I never have to have it all the way up to get clear sounding audio or to feel like I can actually hear something. Which with my AirPods was a constant problem.The mic on these, I am thoroughly impressed with. Compared to my AirPods, its like award winning lol. People on calls usually can’t tell I am using a headset at all.I’m not sure how long it truly takes to charge them, as I haven’t charged them from dead to full yet. I imagine from the little bit of charging I did do when they first arrived they will take a little bit, but to me it’s worth it.Overall, I feel my money was well spent on a good product. I got a better bang for my buck with these beats than I did with my airpods. The compactness of AirPods are nice, and I like a compact item so having a larger device is something to get used to but I still think it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024",AFGMDHUXSF76BWEEVF5IAL7E6NKQ,True,62,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R19726D1M2NGAW,B0C8PR4W22,"4.0 out of 5 stars An expensive, high quality headset with some pros, and some strong cons to consider.",Weave™,4,"Beats has been around for quite some time, and has developed a good reputation alongside Bose, Sony and others. So I was excited to try these out - especially after my experience with Anker.PROS: the sound quality is very good. Not Bose good, but close. Close enough for airline travel. The headset rests on my big head with no issue and the pressure from wearing them isn't uncomfortable.I like the Transparency mode, especially when travelling, so I can hear the crew announcements easily.I also like that it comes with a 1/8"" audio male-to-male cable for use on airlines with traditional audio jacks.And - controlling the headsets using my iPhone is a nice feature.CONS: The perceived air pressure on the eardrums from full noise cancellation is STRONG. Almost uncomfortably so, and you'll see similar comments from others here in the Reviews section. It takes getting used to. I almost sent these back, but in the end, the pros outweighed this issue. You may find it too much for you.Expensive: these are pricey, and if you're going to drop this much coin, you should at least try the Bose QuietComfort cans first. While they'll lack the iPhone integration, they may end up being more comfortable for you.Bass: ummm - where IS the bass? These are Beats, right? Studio Pro edition? I'm not really getting the lower frequencies here. Maybe I missed a step during setup. The sound quality is good but I thought a lot of Beats' reputation was based on the bass.All in all, I mostly don't regret my decision. But definitely try more than one model before you decide for sure.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2024",AE66YM6J42DY23ARCZVC74NSZSAQ,True,88,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RES90N3UIN1OY,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth it,Erica 🌞,5,"I was looking for heavier headphones to wear while working out. These work great, I can bend over and they won’t slip off. They were pricey but worth it in my opinion. Sound quality is top tier, battery lasts a few days if using a few hours a day. They do suction to your ears a bit so my ears are tender after wearing them for over two hours but it’s still mostly comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AGRW3MRCTLBBRFXD5UCXWMIJKMEQ,True,4,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3DRKG1RCX4FWA,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Attractive - effective,Art W.,5,"I was wary about a rapper recommending headphones to me, a melodic musician. I bought on sale with the fear I'd have to return them. Surprisingly, they are excellent; the sound, including bass response is rich and vibrant without the curse of booming bass. I wear hearing aids behind my ears and the cups fit over them very nicely, boosting the sound as needed with earpiece controls. They are also very attractive and fold into the included case for carrying. To nitpick: the ear cups could be a bit larger but suffice. An excellent product!","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AGOVEJJB6MHSPSQU6YHLLWXNB32Q,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RDHOFA7MKRYPL,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars THEY DESERVE NEGATIVE STARS,Warning Please Read!!!,5,"Please read this review if you are thinking of buying g these headphones!!!!! They are on sale for a reason, and it’s not because they are good or even meh. I compared them to my old Studio 2’s from 2013 (11 years old) and they are horribly different.I had high hopes for beats since I use the fit pros, and boy was I disappointed. More than disappointed I was let down. I still have my Beats Studio 2’s from 2013 the silver titanium color way, and I’ve loved every minute of having them because of the loudness and club-like thump they have to them. They are relatable to one of the cars that passes by you with the windows shaking because the bass is so hard. Especially after 11 years that they still work and function the same as they did when I bought them minus a few cosmetic defects. So with high hopes and promises that these Beats Studio Pros would be just as great, I ordered them and got the maroon color because I liked the color. I should have known that if the colors have to be nice to make up for how awful the headphones were I wouldn’t have even glanced at these.These headphones are great if you want to listen to something and you have a hearing aid so it doesn’t hurt your ears. The sound is not nearly as loud as the 2013 model and being 11 years old I was very surprised. Apple has ruined the name Beats and all of their headphones minus the earbuds since all earbuds are relatively the same(I have the fit pros now and they are great) but the fact that brand new headphones can’t outperform 11 year old ones is just sad. Disappointing. A let down. I was thinking the new model would be the same if not better than the old ones I have since the treble and mids may have changed in the time I’ve had the headphones but I was so wrong. They sound almost the exact same with one major difference. The bass. The one thing that I feel most people loved about Beats was the bass and how it would sound like you just walked into a club when you wear them. I was utterly distraught. The studio pros on Bluetooth were so bass negative I thought I didn’t have the volume all the way up. Once I realized I did I thought maybe it was just the fact I wasn’t using one of the ‘3 specialized audio modes’ that the new model has. Even there I was let down. I played different songs, tried different audio settings on my phone like bass boosted and acoustic and rock but none of them helped the headphones. So after all the thoughts that went flooding through my head, one thing stuck out. Apple had ruined the classic Beats headphones. Don’t get me wrong the sound of the treble and mids was fine but still nothing compared to an 11 year old model. I was highly disappointed overall and would not recommend these to anyone even if they have an unlimited budget. It is just not worth the letdown.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2024",AFDOLKER2GHNCK53GDAR2YNQPMVQ,True,74,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2UXJLAZR33T40,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Normally, I would not spend the money on these because they are expensive, but my husband bought these for me as a gift and they are the greatest gift ever. Use these normally when I go to the gym to tune out to any clinking weights and just so I can focus on my music or podcast. But the game changer is when I use these for daily chores while my kids are napping. I can still listen to music that I want, and listen to a podcast WHILE I am vacuuming and I don’t miss a thing. These are also great when my husband gets home from work and I’m trying to put dinner together together. I put these on and I can tune out the noise and the kids so I don’t go insane. The noise canceling on these is perfect.

R3REKPIFS6TC75,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Review And Comparison To The Sennheiser Momentum 4,vladislav grutsenko,4,"Highs: Beats > Sennheiser.High frequencies are good in both headphones, but Sennheiser has them more emphasized. Sometimes it feels like if you crank them slightly higher you're gona hear sibilants. It's on the edge and this is not the most pleasant edge to me. However, the sound is accurate and somewhat distinctive in the upper-frequency range for the Sennheiser. As for the Beats, highs are as detailed as on the Sennheiser (if not more) but not overemphasized.Mids: Beats > Sennheiser.Sennheisers have a so-called v-shaped sound profile so it feels like Beats have way more mids. It might be even too much at first, but you get used to it. Beats are more detailed and fast. Sennheiser feels muddy in comparison (but still very precise and detailed compared to Sony and Bose). I think it's partially because of overemphasized bass that brings distortion into the mid range. You start hearing things that were not originally intended to be there by artists. Because of this, Sennheiser sounds more ""musical"", it fills the voids between the instruments and produces an overall ""dense"" sound. And the Beats have more reference sound. For many instrumental tracks (rock, metal) Beats might sound boring and hollow. I can't blame the headphones because such music is usually mastered to sound good on consumer electronics. And you can't put good ""dense"" sound into an average stereo system. It will sound too muddy and.. just bad. So they leave the voids between the instruments and try to separate them. But on a reference headphone, this sounds... well... too reference :)Electronic music is a completely different story, this is where Beats shine! Electronic sounds are way more precise. And with Beats, you get this precision (especially in the complicated EDM tracks; I mostly listened to psytrance, psychill, idm, etc. But an average techno/trance sounds good as well). Sennheisers sound fine too, but only until you compare them with Beats.Bass: Sennheiser > Beats.The Beats are precise, again, and so is the bass. If the bass was intended in the music that you listen to - you will hear it. And you will hear exactly as much as it was planned by an artist. Rap songs sound great because of that, as well as some EDM tracks with massive sub-bass. As for the Sennheisers, well, they are v-shaped still so they add a subtle amount of bass to the overall mix, and in most cases, this sounds fine and even fun. It also comes without surprise that in bass-heavy rap songs, it starts to sound too overemphasized. In terms of precision, Sennheisers are not as precise but still hold their ground well against sony/bose/etc.Soundstage: Sennheiser > Beats.Soundstage feels subtly more open on the Sennheisers. Probably this is because they are not as precise and produce more ""parasite"" harmonics that make instruments sound further from your head. I like this effect but this makes me wonder if it's possible to achieve a good soundstage for closed headphones without compromising the sound speed and precision.ANC/Transparency: Beats > Sennheiser.Beats are slightly better in noise cancellation and noticeably better in transparency mode. Not as good as AirPods Max, but kinda close. Sennheiser is not bad though, it's just not as good. Wind can be a problem for both headphones, but I don't care. Beats are better at blocking fan noise but may overemphasize it in the transparency mode.Mic: Sennheiser >> Beats.Sennheiser microphones are superior both in terms of volume and quality. Beats is really mediocre, on the edge of what I would call ""usable"" for the zoom meetings. On top of that Beats mic sounds really quiet in Windows 11 rendering itself useless. I hope new firmware/drivers will fix that.Ergonomics: Sennheiser > Beats.I like Sennheiser more. Beats have smaller earcups with stiffer ear cushions. Also, the clamping force on my average-sized head is obnoxiously strong. Not to the point when I feel a headache after wearing them for a few hours but still too much in my opinion. However, I like the fact that Beats are more compact. It makes a difference when I listen to them in bed, for example. They don't rub as much against the pillow and don't produce a lot of noise like Sennheisers.Sennheiser ear cups are rotating 180 degrees when on the Beats, they barely move. This is important if you want to move one headphone back to open your ear when you need to listen to somebody or something from the outside world quickly. Or if you're a DJ and need to hear monitors with one of your ears :). Sennheiser earcups pivot and stay perfectly adjacent to your head, unlike the Beats.Connectivity: Beats > Sennheiser.Both headphones are ok when you're near the source, but the Beats stay connected longer as I walk away from it. The usable distance is like ~30% longer. They also perform better for a source behind a wire mesh or a security door. I know that Sennheiser is capable of working with 2 devices simultaneously and this works pretty well. Not sure about the Beats but I don't really care...Controls: Beats >> Sennheiser.Beats are very basic. They don't even have a head detection. And this feels soo good after the glitchy Sennheisers! You can read more details in other Sennheiser reviews, but they are really bad in that aspect. I bit the bullet and used them as my daily drivers, and oh boy... settings were getting changed randomly, I had tons of fantom head detection events, and when I wanted to put them on or off I almost always accidentally touched the right earcup sensor and triggered something (usually play/pause).","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AHW6Y7QXQTDZZQHKFGWJCKTN66BA,True,257,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

First of all the great premium package, and the bag they bring is great. I have NEVER worn a headphone that has this sound quality, i was amazed the first time i tried them. SOUND IS CLEAR on the iPhone is everything so smooth, has automatic sync, has spatial audio, basically is a surround sound on your ears. Amazing technology for the price. My family once they tried them their reaction was priceless.So yes would i spend 400$ for this or more, definitely yes, it's a win win!, will update as i need to try them at the gym, but I'm sure they will be to notch with the ANC they transport me to pleasant land.

They are beautiful they look great. Comfort is about an 8 out of ten but I can hardly hear because the volume is very low. Am I missing something? Maybe I’m doing something wrong but if it is what it is than it is not very trustworthy to sell a product that doesn’t do the most important thing it was created to do. Besides the fact that I have to sit in a quiet room to actually hear on them. Is that part was different this product would get a definite 10/10 from me because the sound is crisp. The all around quality of the product is very high all the way down to the box and zipper bag it came in. The texture of them is so comforting I love it but I am definitely conflicted*update-It did get better after I plugged it into my device. Pairs easily with all my devices flawlessly.

Not very attractive, but they do an adequate job at cancelling outside noise and they have excellent sound quality. I am a music snob and I work from home. My wife also works from home and we have two teenagers that are either playing or bickering constantly.

When I need to practice (I am also a musician) I plug in the cord (included) to my Nord Stage 3 88 keyboard (essentially an electronic piano), and I am still oblivious to what's happening around me. Occationally, like when I have something cooking in the oven, I have the headphones on ambient mode and I can clearly hear timer in the kitchen go off. It is worth the buy if you catch it on sale.

R1HAR6IQABGEHG,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall not too bad I guess,Ashley M.,4,"I'm a stay at home mom and I was given these (my request) for mothersday. I'd like the highest level of noise cancelation to be better. I can still hear my kids when it's on, not as well as when it's off but I expected it to be better because of the price. But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones. If you don't mind hearing some noise all the time and just wanna drown out smaller back ground noise, have a small head/ears, enjoy a little less bass then these are great for the price.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AHGBWUQCNMQ2NZBJ4ZPFFNHVNCTQ,True,1,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Bluetooth works well but will randomly switch to my iphone handset when on a call. Left earcup clicks when my jaw moves like when chewing or talking, have to make slight adjustments to where that ear cup is on my head to resolve the clicking when it happens. It is a physical issue with where the ear cup meets the band, I assume at the pivot point, causing the clicking that I’ve read many others have experienced as well. Disappointing for the price and being an Apple product but overall still decent and much cheaper than airpod max’s if you want a set of affordable over the ear headphones that play well with iOS.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHLXPJMU2VWR7M4WSMJ7P373EOJQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The cushioning is a very high grade plastic which is comfortable when the headphones are being worn for hours at a time and they are secure. I wear eyeglasses and I use these headphone when I am on my laptop watching a movie or videos on Youtube. The area where the eyeglass arm rests does not hurt but my ears will get warm and I take the headphones off for a few minutes to let the air circulate at the ears to cool down, this for my use is the only negative. Otherwise these are a nice upgrade to the $60.00 or less headphones. I was able to use bluetooth to connect to my Apple devices. However, I have encountered a snag to be able to connect to my Samsung tv that is connected to a wireless soundbar which I am still investigating. In the meantime I am enjoying and glad I purchased these Beats headphone and they were marked down making them a good deal. I would recommend and give as a gift. There is a lighter weight more recent version of these Beats at a lower price.

But very noticeable have better sound quality than the AirPods Pros 2. The other good thing about these, these can last for 40 maybe 40+ hours. Either way, these are amazing. The only downside about the beats studios pros, is the phone call quality. Its a major step down, from the AirPods pros 2. Also, when trying to connect these to the PS5, PlayStation wireless bluetooth functionality seems to only be limited to their only products. And sadly not third parties accessories.

Good noise canceling quality depending on the volume of the music you listen to. If you are streaming shows, you can still hear things in the background.

The noise cancellation filter is of good quality, canceling outside noise to bring clarity to high frequencies, midrange frequencies, and bass frequencies. This quality product will last but must be handled with care; support is available for troubleshooting if needed by Apple. The convenient Bluetooth feature allows connectivity to any smart device.

RZGEO464CSXFR,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product for the price,Eric,4,"After using the best studio pros for a while, I can definitely say that these are basically the Apple AirPod max’s but for a quarter of the price which is an amazing deal for the quality of headphones you are getting.Apple owns Beats and you get most of the features as if having AirPods and the accessibility of using them with iPhones . If you have an iPhone and pair it with the Beats Studio Pros, they will automatically pop up on your phone to connect like aipods do. Some of the same features include: being able to switch transparency/noise cancellation mode through your control center on your iPhone, Spatial Audio, Apple chip, ect. It is also lighter than Apple airpod max’s which is a huge plus for staying on your head. It includes an easy control system on the left ear on the headphones to allow you to play/pause, skip/go back, volume up/volume down, accept call/end call which is nice to be able to change the volume on the headphones which is something AirPods can’t do. They are very comfortable and sort of glue to your head and ears. You can adjust the headphones to fit to your liking as well. The color ways and the matte accent makes these headphones look slick to wear and overall they took out some small Beats decals on the previous headphones to make it look clean.Some flaws I have for the headphones are 1. That when you take them off your music will not automatically pause. This makes you take a small little step in either pausing the music on your phone, through the headphones, or continuing to play the music. I like how on the AirPods they automatically pause when you take an ear bud out so I wish these headphones did the same especially when Apple owns them. 2. They could be a tad louder. Don’t get me wrong, they are overall loud headphones but you have to get over half way in the volume to notice a loud change. Below halfway seems too quiet to me personally. 3. The case it comes in is slick, but the zipper design is annoying to get the headphones in and out of the case because the zipper hole is too small. Also the case is soft shelled and not hard so it’s not as protective as I want. 4. It’s a fingerprint magnetOverall if you are looking for high quality Bluetooth headphones, these are the best bang for your buck. Yes there are some flaws to this product, but the price is too hard to beat. These easily are the same audio quality as the airpod max if not better at quarter of the price. The design of the Beats Studio Pros have a better design than the max’s so I’d definitely suggest getting these if you want to save money.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2024",AGNFNGIJ4UL3ZZAKLWLBZ4BGPDMQ,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

In any case, the headphones we packaged and shipped promptly after ordering, and arrived in perfectly new condition, and were the exact set I expected. There was 80% charge at delivery. The cord to charge was included, but I had to raid my old iPhone’s charger to actually plug it into the socket—be aware that the charging portion is NOT included in the set. This is not a big deal, as we have several chargers from older Apple products. But if you do not have Apple products, you will need to buy a charger.

They cover the entirety of my ears so they don't press on the cartilage causing pain (especially since I wear glasses). They have 3 settings for sound, ""noise cancelling"", ""off"", and ""transparency"". The noise cancelling still lets sound in when nothing is playing from them, but when something is playing you can't really hear anything outside unless it's super noisy. Off makes it be just like a regular pair of headphones, and transparency is actually pretty amazing- put them on, nothing playing, and in this mode you can hear everything almost as perfectly as if you didn't have them on. When music is playing you can still hear some stuff from outside, but you still have to pause it to hear what someone is saying though.I bought an off brand pair of headphones for $25 in October and the pairing and ease of use was actually kind of complicated. BUT THESE. These are so simple, I love it. They also connected right away.My only gripe is maybe it could stay on the top of my head better, but I think that's because of how fine/thin my hair is and everything just falls off it.

Additionally, there is no tone to indicate that I successfully turned on the headphones. I can’t always tell if they are on unless they pair to a device.

It was super cool, I could just turn off my nerves and work, live, move, do sports, etc. Beats has waaaay worse noise-cancellation, in the background in all modes I still hear what is going on around.The only things that is better comparing to Sony, is the stronger construction, for gym it is a plus.All other options Beats is worse. Sony is a winner.It is also a discomfort while switching between connected devices, take several some time till the headphone understands that it has to play on another device.Anyway, if I had to buy this at its original price, I would not do that. Not worth it.If I was an iPhone user, I would take AirPods Max, if no compatibility issue, I would still take it.So, if ANC is important for you, here is the list of winners:1. Apple AirPods Max2.

R3PKX54VHP9QXO,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones,margaret juarez,4,"I haven’t own a pair of headphones this is my first pair so my review may be biased on the quality of the headphones from sound to design but I have asked people around that have own many pairs of headphones for their opinion about this set and I will be incorporating their opinion on the sound.These headphones sound very good for its price, I was looking for something that wouldn’t break the bank (I’m a broke college student), have good sound quality, and noise cancellation. I wanted something to block out the little noises and hustle and bustle when I study in the library, in a coffee shop, at home, or outside. I read a lot of reviews from different sites and watched videos about the beast pro before I committed to them. What was important for me besides the sound quality was how good the noise canceling was. Many said that for the price it was a good head set for its quality, it was equal to the the quiet comfort 45 Bose headphones.Now the sound quality in my opinion is good, I will say though that for classical and R&B music it doesn’t give it justice. You can hear the music just fine but when you are in a noisy environment, even with noise cancellation, you have to put up the volume to hear lower and softer melodies. For more up beat music the music sounds better especially like pop, rap, country, etc. There isn’t a lot of base but you can control it’s sound, you just have to have the iPhone 11 or 12 and up to do that, I have an SE 2nd gen.The opinion that I have asked of others are an overall 7/10The battery life is amazing, it last for long periods of time, for 10 hrs of music straight the battery holds to a good percentage. If I hear for a few hrs of music a day for a week, I don’t have to charge it until the next week. And it charges so quickly too, it takes up to 30 min to charge full.I like how it have its own pouch to store it in with its adapters and charger, and have an extra zipper pocket to store in anything extra.Overall these a pretty good headphones if you don’t want to spend over $300 for a pair.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AFJACG5ME2ZWJUUIUIXBOYBEYPKQ,True,6,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I was eyeing this on Best Buy's website when they went onsale for $199. I wanted to double check Amazon and found an even better deal from Amazon Warehouse for $150! It stated the box might have some damage but the headphones were brand new. When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see everything was in great shape. I've only had the opportunity to use them 1 day but so far I am very pleased! The sound is great, the integration with my iphone is great!

R19FNCEBWTLWCK,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and Noise Canceling!,Zack,5,"These headphones are everything I dreamed they'd be. Many people have told me I could find the same quality or better for cheaper, which may or may not be true, but I'm honestly glad I got these. (They were on sale anyway).Even though I might agree they're overpriced, they really are outstanding. I don't know that much about sound quality, and the differences that exist between products, but if I could describe the sound coming out of these headphones: I feel like I can hear every cord on guitars, every beat on drums, and the very vibration in my favorite artists' voice while they're singing. This is of course all further improved by seemless noise canceling.Obviously, it would not be possible to block out every sound (like the insanely loud truck horns when I go outside to take the trash out), but I will say my family members have had to SHOUT to get my attention at times lol. And I mean they were seriously screaming bloody murder. I really don't hear anything but music when I have these things on and in noise cancelling mode. In fact, at one point I had them in transparency mode without realizing and I could hear the ambient noises coming from TV still (which is what alerted me to them not being in noise cancelling), so I switched them back in the app and the sound from my TV was cut out completely in a second. I'm not going to lie, it impressed me. Maybe I'm easy to impress.I could probably go on and on about these, but bottom line: yes they are an overpriced brand name and not the only good product you could get, but if you do decide to buy them you won't be disappointed or feel it's a waste of money. If you want to splurge and treat yourself, these headphones are a safe choice.And hey, if you're filthy rich, what do I care what you do with your money?","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AHSQFTDH4ON7KJQS5YF6JMRUHASQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I do sometimes have some trouble with where they sit on the top of my head after a while if it's in a certain spot, but overall I've been able to wear them for hours at a time cleaning the house or sitting and listening to music and I think they've been great. I wanted them to be able to pair easily with my iphone which they do, and the main purpose I bought them for was to be able to wear them while on walks and still be able to hear my surroundings. The passthrough feature is pretty good, although I did notice that wind noise is a bit loud with 2 of the 3 noise cancellation settings, but not terrible. I also saw people complaining that it was hard to tell which setting you are on, but the sounds are very different for each so if you just quickly memorize which is associated with the appropriate setting, it's really not hard at all to know which one you are on based on the sound.

R2X5RBKVPANSSN,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars I didn't need them, stopped myself a few times, but broke down and bought them and so glad I did.",movin and groovin,5,"I already have original Airpod Pros that I like a lot, although I've gone thru 5 plus replacements due to a cracking noise. I also had some older Bose wired noise cancelling that worked really well and the AirPod Studio are too expensive, A few month back I read an article comparing the Beats Studio with the AirPod Studios. They both have outstanding features and the report gave the Beats a slight advantage. I saw the Beats Studio on sale a couple of times and was tempted to buy, but talked myself out of it. Then Amazon had their October Prime days sale and on the second day these were at a really really good price. So I bought them with one rule to myself. I couldn't open the box until I sold the Bose on Ebay, which happened pretty quickly, so I ended up paying less than $100 after selling my Bose. I opened the box, put them on a good charge and used them every day for almost 2 weeks before needing a charge. I use them for watching tv and they sound fantastic. They are really good at noise cancellation and Spacial Audio sound better than my AirPod Pros. Love that I can go a looooong time between charges. The AirPod lasted around 4 hours. These can go up to 40. The only complaint is that the padding is not as soft as the Bose and after 3 hours or so, I would have to pull them off and let the top of my ears get a rest from the pressure. The other complaint is that when I'm out walking my dog, there is a very loud buffeting noise on windy days. It's just the shape of the headphones and probably happens on most full size headphones.These use USB-C cables so I plugged them into my Macbook Pro using USB-C and played some lossless music from Apple Music and WOW. I love listening to older music from the 70s and it really has great bass. I've been turning off noise cancelling/transparent mode to get longer life and it has been about 3 weeks of use with only one recharge.One thing is that the carrying case is a bit thicker than the Bose so they might not fit in my favorite carry on bag for my ipod and other gadgets that I can't live without when flying.

They are amazing, and totally surpassed my expectations.The reason I used to only buy ear buds (the kind that have those rubber peices that go deep into your ear) was because I thought that was the only way to get good quality sound and lots of base. I like to dance to fast paced pop music and sweat to the oldies and have my music LOUD. I always assumed ear muff type of headphones would make most of the music/volume escape around the sides. But I was so wrong, these Beats headphones make it sound like you're at the club, or like the music is being performed in the room with you...I heard things in my music that I've never heard before; a subtle drum or base in the background that I didn't know was there, a background singer adding a note at a certain point...And yet it didn't change the song but enhanced it. I didn't know music could sound like this! I'm 32 and kicking myself for not investing in a nice pair of headphones all these years. I dont see how it could get better than this. If you love music, like really love listening to music, you need to have these! Oh, and the 'transparency mode' blew my mind. It actually works and I have no idea how. Charge lasts for weeks (listening to music about an hour or 2 a day). I guess the only downfall is keeping them clean, though I'm sure there's a product out there for that.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AFQHYSP2HWNWRTFYZ25WP2SFJ3FA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The ear cups are soft and buttery, and feel nice against the skin. The noise cancelation works really good and it's nice to have the transparent option.

R1MQZB3KB7QTTU,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for sound and comfort.,Local girl0721,5,"I have always wanted a set of Beats and took advantage of a sale Amazon had to purchase these. So happy I did as they are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. I use these at work and at home and I love the noise cancellation aspect, the sound when music is playing, and the comfort when wearing. No ear buds falling out of my ears, or worrying where I laid these. Wish they were black, or green, or red, but they are amazing as they are.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AGPU77WWYS65ZNSVRBKNQF4SUZSQ,True,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The brown in browning, the feel is velvet, the settings are easy to manage, bass is loud.

R2BRR7LFSRRH0X,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Worth it for the discounted price,Timothy,4,"I used to have an Airpods but I always wanted a pair headphones than earphones so I was stoked to see that this was on sale. I’m no audiophile so I don’t actually mind what the pro reviews say about the nitty gritty aspects. Based on my experience (at least when I tested it out when I received this purchase), I like the sound. It’s clear, the spatial audio is also nice, I loved the ANC and Transparency modes. I also owned a pair of cheap headphones a few years back and I’m pretty certain these experiences are very much new to me in a good way. However, I will have to echo the reviews of tech Youtubers that auto pause is not included and I’m pretty bummed about that one because that should have been standard.For the original price of 349 though I wouldn’t recommend people to buy this. Only when it was discounted, which is what I did - for 170USD.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2024",AHFBSDI6TY2Q6JF5ICD3BQEF46CQ,True,0,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
