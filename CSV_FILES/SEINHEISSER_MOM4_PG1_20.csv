R1AC58E4VI0C2P,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Music to my ears!,DDAY,5,"I just received these Sennheiser Momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago. I bought them for $270, and now I see you can get them $20 less. I made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on Amazon simply because I have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. Such as often times when it comes to Bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. In my case, that was the case. The firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and I was off and running. I have owned, and sold several headsets, from JBL, Beats, SkullCandy, Sony and yes, Bose. Now, for me, and how I like my music to sound, the Sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding Bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. Mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. Wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! The lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. The Sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. Touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. Yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. Comfort. These cans are extremely comfortable. Even for my large head. Ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. Could it use more cushion? Maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. Weight. Yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! The cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. And that is something I can appreciate. Are these cans perfect? They are as close to perfect that you will get (IMHO) on Bluetooth headsets. Are there better cans out there? Sure, If you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. Even Sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. Of course they will sound better.One thing I didn't discuss is noise canceling. They get the job done in fine fashion. I have tried the Sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the Senn 4s. I have made several phones calls, FaceTime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! I am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how I sound, or, how the other end sounds. Lastly, battery life. It claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. That is a fact, as I have tested that claim and 59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge. Mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.Accessories. Well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. You will need a dongle (I purchased one from Amazon) and they sound great. It will sound different, and you may need to adjust you equalizer. The case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type C cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to movies or music that the plane is playing. And it all is neatly stored within the case.Final thoughts:I honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on Amazon is these headsets have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. Perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? Not sure, all I know is mine cans fired right up, and I did the update straight away. These cans have Bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. Yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. Much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. It may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle, but once you do, it's a piece of cake.I decided to take a chance, I did my research outside of Amazon reviews, and watched the pros on YouTube, and that's how I ended up buying these. Big risk considering I am a world away. Give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AFGWGUIMRTG4L3M52MRY7QDFRDIQ,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1FU9D18YOSOS6,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Ignore the complaints, these are the best.",MA Stewart,5,"Let me say upfront I am a long-time audiophile. I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones. Until recently, I've avoided all BT/wireless headphones because they presented too much compromise for my tastes. Noise cancellation adversely effected audio quality and/or gave me a headache. Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.Here's what I found:In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s. Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2023",AEZIPLEDJYRIGVJKWFWRH44LK4TQ,True,375,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2CIT7PKP36F3M,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound quality, great battery life. Noise cancellation is OK. Updates could make it 5/5.",Amazon Customer,4,"Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones & headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what ""Comfort calling"" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous ""Connected/Disconnected"" messages while listening on a different device.Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGUYYNC6G5RGNFL4HD6LXEB6JJCA,True,31,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1IVGTBWY7A3K4,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars First Sennheiser purchase, highly impressed!",Shara Simpson,5,"I obsessively researched before buying these Sennheiser Momentum 4s. I had it narrowed down to Bose QC Ultras, Sony WH-1000XM5s, or these. Ultimately it came down to sound quality for me. The quality and clarity of any music genre I tested it with was far and away superior to Sony or Bose. These don't have the absolute best ANC compared to those, but it's still top tier. If you are looking for a fully immersive, lost in the music type of experience with your headphones, Sennheiser is the way to go. And the battery life is absolutely insane! I've had these for 3 weeks with almost daily use (at least an hour a day but usually more) and I haven't had to charge them at all since the first initial charge - they are still sitting at 40%! Sennheiser says they should last 60 hours with ANC at half volume and that seems accurate. No other headphones come close to that kind of battery life. I really love the Sennheiser app as well, it's packed full of useful features. The EQ on these is fully adjustable using the app. I used the ""My Sound Check"" feature and created sound profiles for various genres of music and places of use, but you can also manually adjust the 5-band EQ. You can save each sound profile and even use the Sound Zone feature to have the headphones automatically switch to a different sound profile based on your location (ex. gym settings versus work settings). There is also a Bass Boost toggle if you want head pounding bass. I really like the two-tone look of these - I got them in white, but the headband is covered in a very nice textured tan fabric and the earcups are tan as well. They are extremely comfortable for hours of use at a time. The case is super sturdy and nice. I put a size comparison pic in this review with the case next to my Kindle - the case is large since the headphones don't fold. This makes them less than ideal for use when traveling because they do take up a lot of space in your bag. The first week of use, I did have connection issues. They would randomly disconnect from whatever music streaming service I was using at the time and I would have to reconnect. Thankfully that went away and I haven't had any further connectivity problems. I don't use these for phone calls so can't review the mic or call quality yet. Overall I think I made the right choice with these, and am extremely happy with my purchase. I would recommend to anyone!","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AFPBVELJBKTT3FYLFSJ7RHINHVFA,True,2,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R27AA754NCZRA9,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good on paper, bad on my head",Sam,3,"I was going back and forth between Sony WH-1000XM5 (XM5) and these headphones (SM4), and I decided to give these a shot since at the time of this purchase, I was able to get these for $279.83 before taxes while the XM5 are listed at ~$400 before taxes.On paper, the SM4 sounded great, double the battery life, supposedly better sound quality, and a not-so-shabby noise cancelling.However, after trying them for a week, I decided to return them. I will list the pros and cons below.PROS 1. Long battery life – I only charged it once during the whole week and it was still going strong. 2. Very solid construction – premium materials that feel good to the touch. 3. Pretty nice carrying case – feels solid and durable, and you don't need to fold the headphones when you put it in so it's simpler to stow in case. BUT I have to reset the positions of the earcups to fit into case, which means I have to always re-adjust to my head size before putting it on. 4. Great sound – I'm not an audiophile, but it sounded good. A friend said he picked up on more chords behind a Taylor Swift song that he hasn't heard before (he listens to Taylor Swift 24/7). 5. Sleek design – unlike the SM3, the SM4 has design that I like: minimalistic and modern.CONS 1. Subpar app-headphone interface – the app is glitchy, and I find myself wait around 10 seconds for the app to say ""connected"" to the headphones (even though the headphones are connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth); after which point, I can go in and change some settings. Also, I did have some stutters in the app that gave me an overall feel of unpolished. 2. Too heavy and too much clamping force – on paper, the weight and clamping force differs by 0.1-ish, but from trying out my friends' XM5s and my SM4, I feel a pretty noticeable difference in how hefty the headphones feel on my head. Simply put, SM4 feels tight on my head and XM5 feels like I can forget that I’m wearing them after a while—this is personal preference, but personally, SM4 felt less comfortable and a tad too heavy for long study sessions. 3. Headache-inducing noise cancelling – the noise cancel isn't as good as the XM5 indeed, but I think there is a bigger problem: the noise cancelling feels peculiarly headache-y. I have airpod pros, plus I have tried the XM5s, and I have to say, the SM4's noise cancelling is by far my least favorite. If I were to describe it, I would say it feels like the feeling I get from being on an airplane for 5+ hours with headphones on. All in all, I opted to have no noise cancelling on due to this uncomfortable feeling it gives me. 4. Touch control – the touch control is pretty responsive, but even if I touch the very edge of the earcups, it registers as a gesture, which gets annoying when I'm trying to adjust my headphones or taking them off for a second. After a few days, I almost wanted to turn them off. ALSO, XM5's cupping gesture to activate transparency mode is extremely desirable, especially since I'm a college student who finds myself studying with my friends a lot. AND the SM4 does not have a gesture to turn off noise cancelling; I have to either pinch in/out multiple times or go into the app and adjust the slider, and it gets very annoying quick.If you have read this far, I applaud your diligence to find the best headphones for you. Personally, I have ordered the XM5 and I will try it on and probably keep it. BUT, an advise for you if you are like me. I dug through the internet and have looked at countless written, video, and professional reviews of so many headphones, but I have to say, it all comes down to personal preference. You MUST go to a Best Buy, where they have headphones on racks that you can try on for yourself. Also, don’t be afraid to order them on amazon and try it out for a week and return them and move onto the next one. Amazon’s return policy is pretty good and if you use the headphones with care and keep the packaging that the headphones came in, you can most likely return them for free. I hope you find the right pair of headphones for yourself, reader.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2023",AE4ZGTN75KVUPUK7VO5OXU4BKWJA,True,119,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3C9NCI2LLQD48,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser vs Sony vs Apple,Calder Akin,5,"After watching countless hours of review videos and sampling multiple headphones firsthand I narrowed my final selections down to the Momentum 4’s ($280 currently on Amazon), and a pair of certified refurbished (eBay) AirPod Max’s ($390) and Sony Xm5’s ($280). My budget was under $400. I also considered the Bowers & wilkins px7 s2 but didn’t have a chance to try them out firsthand so I excluded them from my selection process.Ultimately I decided to go with the Sennheisers. To me the Sonys are the most comfortable (so light, it’s as if there’s nothing on your head!) but the ear-cup itself is the shallowest of the three- my ears stick out a little so this was a consideration. Also, I have an iPhone and many reviews said the audio was better on the XM5’s when connected to androids due to the Ldac etc. The Apples sound the best when it comes to immersive experience (spacial audio wow!) but the limited EQ flexibility, and the extra money I’d have to spend on a real case plus wires to plug into a jack when flying outweighed (no pun intended- but these things ARE heavy!) the luxury feel.The Momentum 4’s (M4) are very comfortable with plush faux leather on the ear cups. I wish they were a bit bigger of an oval shape (something to consider if you have big ears) but for me they fit just right. The ear cup has more substantial padding and recesses slightly deeper than the Sonys over the ear. All three of these headphones have the same sliding headband design which I really like.Where the M4’s really shine however is in the audio department. It just sounds so clean in my opinion. I own a pair of Beats Studio 3’s which are my go-to gym headphones. You don’t get a “pounding” heavy sound with the M4’s like you do with the Beats but that’s fine with me. They also don’t get as loud as my Beats but I didn’t buy them for either of these reasons. I wanted a pair of headphones for traveling, taking the dog for a walk, and listening to music/tv around the house. Speaking of watching TV with them, there’s an EQ preset through the app which is designed for podcasts. I set the headphones to this feature the other night while watching a basketball game and it sounded amazing! Also there’s this cool feature for phone calls which you can adjust through the app where it sounds like you aren’t wearing headphones and you can hear your own voice clearly - muffled sounding phone calls are a thing of the past!Overall I’m incredibly happy with my purchase. They aren’t quite as comfortable as the Sony’s- it’s not that they’re uncomfortable it’s just they have more weight to them and more of a clamp on the head. And they don’t have the seamless syncing ability and build quality of the Apples. Also, their noise cancelling and transparency mode is slightly below both. But for the price and sound quality these were the best fit for me.Pros:* price ($279 on Amazon currently which is around $70 below retail)* Clean, pure audio that sounds good regardless of your favorite genre of music.* Comfort- plush pads with ample space for my ears to be enclosed. Easily adjustable sliding headband.* Rigid case (slightly smaller than the XM5’s)* Battery life (60 hours!)* Auto-off feature when taken off and not used for 15 minutes or more depending on how you set it (great if you often forget to turn off your headphones!)* Easy to navigate app. I know some have complained about the app but I’ve had zero issues with it- maybe the firmware has been fixed with the most recent update?* No noticeable hissing sound with ANC.* 2 year manufacturers warranty* Usb-c and traditional 3.5mm connectivity. Also they come included with a two-prong airplane jack.Cons:* I appreciate the creativity making most of the functions of the headphones accessible via touchpad on the right ear-cup, but the pinching/expanding feature to adjust ANC/transparency is useless. Thankfully you can just double tap the headset to switch between these settings.* They don’t get super loud, well at least compared to my Beats, so I wouldn’t consider these a great gym option. (Edit: there’s a thread on Reddit that gives some pointers on how to increase the overall volume- especially if you have an iphone. Worth checking out, the adjustments I made did seem to work)* They aren’t water/sweat resistant, which is another reason not to wear them to the gym.* ANC is effective but not on the level of the Sonys or Apples.* The auto pause feature is pretty sensitive. Something to keep in mind if you adjust your headphones often during usage. If you lift them off your head, even to just change position the audio can unintentionally pause. (Edit: there’s a way to turn off this function in the app)TLDR; Best Bluetooth noise cancelling over ear headphones currently available.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2023",AGGIZAHMHFHO4J6OU7FMAHUD4MMA,True,154,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R15B34B8ZDY89M,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and battery life with a couple comprimises,Grant Bohn,5,"If your priority is sound quality and battery life, these are the headphones to get. I listen primarily to electronic music and the bass is just right. It's clear and full, but not overbearing once EQ'd down a couple dB in the app. What you give up for this is comfort and ANC quality. These are not the sort of headphones you forget that you're wearing. They definitely have some heft to them and a higher clamping force than others. They do feel solidly built though. The ANC works well but from other reviews I've read, it falls a bit short compared to Bose and Sony's offerings. It's a give and take, but the momentum's deliver on fantastic sound and industry leading battery life if that's what you're looking for.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AGE7TIJAE6AOGRW2PLXE2CTUAV3Q,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3HDZ4YGKNQ6L5,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Great Sound + Connection Problems + Poor touch controls,Ryan,3,"I just got these headphone. I really like how they feel and sound. The problem I have with these headphones is largely related to its bluetooth features and controls. I have these headphones connected to my phone and my TV. I live in an apartment. As such, these headphones constantly get confused between which bluetooth source to connect to. The result is choppy, broken audio or no audio at all and problems with touch controls.When its my phone's audio that's choppy the solution is to disconnect the tv using the headphone app. However, shortly after disconnecting the tv, the tv reconnects on its own and the problem returns. When its the TV audio that choppy, I have to turn off bluetooth on my phone completely to solve the problem. This again is due to the headphones automatically connecting to the unwanted source.The controls for this headphone are wonky to say the least and often don't work. For example, I will answer a phone call with a touch control but then can't end the phone call with a touch control. Another example is that I can't start or resume playing Spotify on my phone using touch controls. But while the music is playing I can pause, skip, or change the volume. I think some of these problems may be due to the headphones connecting to my tv at the same time. I suspect that my attempts to play or resume music are being sent to my TV (which is off) and not to my phone.The headphone's app is largely useless for attempting to solve these problems. The likely solution to all of these problems is to 'forget' my tv. Meaning, everytime I want to connect my headphones to my tv I would have to pair them with my tv. At this point, I'm likely to return these headphones due to all of these problems.To put all of the above in perspective. I have a pair of Pixel earbuds and I experience none of the above problems.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AF4KKUJCDDGW4ZZLQN23QJMOYFCQ,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
R38QYC50V9S55Y,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Winner of my search for headphones,Chip chipperson,5,"I wanted to find a really good set of over the ear headphones to use at the office and for general use. I tried a few other highly rated models at varying price points. The momentum 4 was the winner for me. I had been using Beats Studio noise canceling earbuds and before that a pair of beats special edition solos. The solos hurt my ears after 2 hours, while the earbuds were great, but they just don’t last long enough for my current work environment without having to charge. Additionally, the earbuds had bad sound wuality for the microphones so they weren’t ideal for phone and teams calls.I orders the sennheiser as my higher end option to evaluate. At first I was a little skeptical of they were going to be the ones. I found that just pairing them to my iPhone worked and was easy, but it did t allow me to use the sennheiser app. I cleared them from my phones Bluetooth lost and paired again using the app, and all was good. The app offers a pretty decent amount of customization and guides you through it. I think the app works well once you get it all configured correctly. There are other headphones on the market that will really rattle your head with bass such as the beats and some of the skullcandy headphones. I found that I don’t care for those headphones when I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks, they are just too tuned for music with deep and solid bass. The momentum 4 delivers some very tight and punch bass. I can’t say I’m wow’d by the bass I get for every track I listen to, but when I get into a bass heavy track or album, I find myself completely wow’d by the performance and range of these momentum 4’s. I believe these are a truer representation of how most songs are actually recorded. The clarity, crisp, clean, tight, punchy, deep, and full sound from these headphones is fantastic. I think my podcasts sound great, music sounds awesome, across a very wide variety of genres. The clarity of my voice in a loud office setting to take phone calls and teams calls is great. The noise canceling is always on unless you adjust to transparency to some degree, and I would have expected this to hinder battery life, but these do a great job canceling ambient noise and fully live up to the claims of 60plus hours of use between charges.I wear these at a minimum 6 hours a day, sometimes as much as 10. They actually keep a connection far better than I expected. I have these paired to my work pc and my iPhone at the same time and can get up and move around our office and leave devices at my desk and never lose connection. While connected to two devices it does a good job seamlessly transitioning from one device to the other based on what apps or programs you are running.Last thing I can think to comment on are the headphone controls. The right earpiece is a touch sensitive pad that picks up on specific but very intuitive gestures. Pausing music, changing tracks, adjusting ANC and transparency, and volume is super easy. The only one of these I think is a little touchy is the volume control, which works fine but it seems a little inconsistent as to how much it adjusts each time. I’ve never had a situation where it was too sensitive and blasted me with sound unexpectedly.Overall, I do recommend these for the money. Like mine so well, I bought a pair for my wife as she was so impressed with mine as well.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AEHRRPY3SLGEJSCWGWWY75QNAMUQ,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3CBBVTHO6OEW6,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love these...,Joe,3,"I own another pair of Sennheiser headphones, the 598SE's, and they're spectacular. They're spacious, clear, wonderful sound stage, light, and powerful.After trying a few other brands of ANC headphones, I learned about the Momentum 4's and immediately thought: OK, Sennheiser is gonna knock it out of the park.Unfortunately, they only got to first base.First, the good:I love how these look, especially the copper accented special edition's that I got. The fabric on the top of the headband makes it look classy.The sound is wonderful. Absolutely the best thing about this product. The sound stage compared to the other major competitors is still a step above.The carrying case is nice, roughly the same size as their competitors. I did wish it could have been a bit smaller (this goes for the competitors too).The swipe controls are the same as a major competitor, which you can also lock. I really like the swipe controls, though having physical buttons would be nice too, especially if you lock the swipe controls.The battery life is beyond spectacular. It destroys their competition and you could probably wear these for several days without needing a charge.Now, the bad:They're quite heavy. The weight on paper seems like they'd be fine, but while wearing them I quickly got fatigued and felt frustrated wearing them (while their competitors, it took much longer to get to that point).They get hot. Not the headset itself, but they form a seal on your head and you'll feel your ears cooking after a short while in a comfortable temperature room. This was another reason I frequently took them off.The earcups are small. They seem EVER SO SLIGHTLY larger than their competitors but... not enough. The 598SE's have big beautiful spacious earcups but these (and their competitors) are very cramped.The ANC is notably weaker in a perfect environment without noise playing than others. With others, I could barely make out any words while playing a song or video rather loud as a test. With the Sennheisers I could make out quite a bit of words and sound. The Momentum 4's have fewer ANC microphones than the competitors.The ANC also almost drops out completely if you have ""windy environment mode"" turned on, for some reason. (Note: I did not test them in a windy environment) If the ANC is important, make sure you have this setting *TURNED OFF* in the app.The app is ok, but what you can ""control"" seems finicky and sometimes its as if changing settings did nothing.The call volume is like 5 generations ago hands-free headset. Very poor quality. The person I tested them with said it sounded like I was outdoors or in a noisy environment when I was in a quiet room.The clamping is quite tight and becomes painful very quickly. It puts a lot of pressure around your ear which can become very uncomfortable. A friend said they loosen up after a couple days but mine stayed far too tight. It felt like a vice. [If it doesnt bother you, this could be a plus, as they seem like they will hold their shape and tightness for a long time]Even lacking almost any physical buttons, they basically threaten you to not get these wet. There is no waterproofing on these. Handle with care.The rest:These are by no means a ""bad"" set of wireless ANC cans, and the price is good, especially if you can get them on sale. If you're just going to be using them in the office or on a commute, they'll probably be fine, especially if you dont want to dole out extra cash for a minor upgrade in ANC. The middling ANC was quite disappointing, but if you have some sounds playing while its on, it works together to make most noises disappear. Unfortunately, sometimes I want to be able to just block out the world, and the Momentum 4's were just not up to the task compared to others.I was really hoping the earcups would be larger and more similar to other Sennheiser headsets I've tried/owned, but they seemed to want to copy the competition, which is a shame. If the cups were larger and the clamping a bit less harsh, I would have accepted their flaws and gone with these. With the laundry list of negatives, you can probably tell why I didnt.Also please note: I am a big guy, and I probably have a larger than average head. This could be contributing to the clamping pressure.Listening to anything on these was a treat. Everything sounded beautiful. Other brands should take a few notes on Sennheisers drivers.I had two main requirements: comfortable ear cups (failed) and long battery life for an upcoming flight (wow did these pass with not flying colors but to outerspace and back colors!). Unfortunately, as they were just not at all comfortable (I could wear my 598SE's for days and not even realize they're there). Their long battery life did not offset the negatives.This may all not be true for you. They definitely stand out and are far more attractive than the competition (at least, the special edition versions are). I am definitely biased towards Sennheiser as I have loved so many of their headsets, but found these disappointing in far too many areas. A few design tweaks could have made these one of the best over the ear cans on the market. As is, they're probably ranked 4th imho.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AHECMYUWUWYVG4EVIGA4QI6LUO4A,True,6,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

Safe to say, they aren't the most noise canceling headphones you can get. So when I went looking for a new pair of wireless over-ears, I had a lot to choose from. I didn’t want sony so that was out of the question.I had whittled it down to four pairs.AirPods MaxBose Quietcomfort UltraSennheiser Momentum 4’s andSonos Ace.Now each of these had their own strengths and weaknesses.AirPods Max are realistically only compatible with apple products and have the worst battery life. However have the same sound signature as my current AirPods.Bose Quietcomfort Ultra has the best noise canceling of the bunch, but was more expensive and ultimately poor battery life.Sonos Ace is the newest one of the bunch, it has decent audio quality and an okay battery. The worst was the microphone, I did not want to have to deal with a microphone that low quality.Which brings me to the ones I went with.Momentum 4 has some of the best soundstage I’ve heard in headphones. The bass is punchy but doesn’t muddy the rest of the track. The touch controls are personally a hit or miss, I love most of them but wish I could pinch or un-pinch to turn transparency fully on or off respectively. I haven’t charged them but once, and they currently have 70% after two days of use.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHMM6BNJ762VVIBOWD4MVGAQWYVA,True,0,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1RV286N7J32C4,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound quality is top notch. ANC is much better than my old Sony. Battery lasts forever.,B. Carter,4,"My daily drivers at home are open ear Hifiman. I don't think any bluetooth ANC headphones will ever match that experience, but Sennheiser comes closer than any I've yet heard. It meets my needs.The noise cancellation is much stronger than my old $120 Sony headphones, and the battery lasts roughly three times as long -- upwards of 60 hours. The audio pass-through feature is also great for those times when you need to listen to your surroundings.I enjoy the style as well. The white/beige color stands out among bluetooth headphones, I think.I've only two complaints: 1) My head is on the larger size, and these are a tight fit. They do break in after awhile (I'm posting this after around 9 months of use), but they still clamp a bit too hard for my liking, and can run hot. Should not be a problem for most people, I think. But for larger headed folks, be aware of what you're getting into. I'm willing to make the compromise for headphones of this quality, though. 2) the headphones have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I find this feature isn't worthwhile. When I'm listening to music through my tablet, and I get a text alert from my phone, there's a staticky sound that just makes it not worth using. That said, I haven't had the other software issues that some users experience. As far as I can tell, Sennheiser has patched it all up -- my experience has been smooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AH2PJ2BKE72VH5SVUL7TI6ZMXXXA,True,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The picture shows comparison with sony 720n. I tried Sony ULT wear (too bassy), Beats Pro (too flat sound signature), Sennheiser Accentum (good but sound quality wasnt best), Sony WH 1000 XM4 (instrument separation wasnt bes). I have Airpods pro 2 but I also wanted a headset as the sound staging of headset is better.Let me address all the cons that you might have heard from youtube influencers. All the cons like headset automatically powering on while in case, auto pause not working etc are gone with latest software update (Software rev 2.13.28)Pros:The sound of Sennheiser momentum 4 is clean with impressive instrument separation and bass that both hits and resonates. The sound staging is shockingly well. For some tracks, it feels they are being played live in front of me. The sound is loud enough for me. I keep them around 70% as I dont want to miss out on all of that intstrument separation!the case, although bigger than sony ULT wear/1000xm4 and bose QC but its not as big as sony 1000 xm5 or other headset that dont fold. Refer to the pic. Because of impressive sound, I am willing to compromise a little on the case size.Impressive ANC. The world goes super quite. I cant hear my keystrokes when I am typing, no hum of AC in the background (my home office is very close to AC unit). Touch controls are bit sensitive but its not bad. You get used to it.I purchased them at $280. So its a steal. I would not buy them at $379. They dont feel premium enough to justify $379 price tag. They do live up to $280 price tag. Not super premium, but not cheap looking by any means.60 hours battery life!The clamping force isnt as tight as its on other Sennheiser headsets like 450 BT or Accentum. Its bit tighter as compared to Sony WH 720 n though. The earcups do seems to get a little hot after a while and I have to let heat out and adjust them a little.Cons:Not perfect for travel due to big case. But I still manage.Def less comfortable than my sony wh720nIf they go on sale for $279 or lower, get them!

R246JYYUL9YOYE,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing battery life, sound quality, and ANC.",Joseph Oscar,4,"I've figured out the bug people seem to run into which is the headset does not output sound. They're onand connected but no music. In my case, it's when an app. is activated for VOIP. I'm currently using the Nextiva phone app to answer calls when I walk away from the desk and when I receive a phone call, I have to force close the app to get music rolling again. Once music is playing, I can open the app again to catch the next call. It's a buggy back and forth but I have it figured out at least. Current phone is Google Pixel 7 Pro. So if anyone else reads this, try force closing whatever secondary app you use for VOIP.I just wanted the main issue to be the first eye catcher but with the headphones working and the equalizer set from the app, these things rock. If I'm working on a car with the ANC turned on, I can barely hear the air compressor running in the background. A little but it's reduced significantly. Now the ear cup material will make you sweat if your in a warm environment so make sure your aware of that. It's not that bad really. I'm sure when it gets warmer out, it will be more noticable. Probably not a good workout headphone either. That I can't comment on. I have to many excuses to go to the gym 😅.Battery life is great. Rated 60+ hours and it definitely is there. I use my headset daily with ANC moving all over the place with whatever I'm doing and music running all kinds of volume levels. I definitely don't charge these very often but get over a week depending on usage. 4-8 hours a day thoughout the work week.Sometimes, the in ear sensor that tells when the headset is on will think I've removed the headset and turn off. I'll just have to push the right side head cup in and it will read again and turn back on. Kind of annoying but I think I need to reach out to Sennheiser about that.Fingure controls, super easy and very responsive. Once you've used the headphones a few times and read the instruction sticker that comes on the headphones, it's muscle memory from there. Your off doing your own thing swiping, pinching and pressing your fingers around using the functions.

RL3M28E80KTYV,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality, solid in every other area",Aaron,5,"Bought these along with the Sony XM5 to compare to my existing Bose 700.Comfort:The Bose 700 I don't find very comfortable, namely the headband, being rather thin, it puts pressure on the top of my head after a couple hours. The Sony had this problem initially, but then I started loosening the headband as much as possible, and being a very light pair, I stopped having that particular issue. All in all I found the Sony much more comfortable than the 700. I could see some folks saying it's more comfortable than the Momentum 4s. However I disagree about that. For me the Momentum 4 are the most comfortable. It has very soft ear pads, much like the Sony. Granted the M4s are heavier, but the weight is distributed very well across the headband, better than the Sony's imo. All in all, it's a close call and the Sony's are really well done comfort wise. Super light and super cushy pads. Could see a reasonable person going in either direction for the win here.Sound quality:I think the XM5 are pretty close to the Bose 700 and could see folks going either way depending on your signature preferences. Personally think I like the Sony a bit better, just more lively than the more neutral Bose. Both are in the same league though. The M4s are way better sound quality wise plain and simple. They're not in the same league. Heck, they're not even playing in the same sport. Find myself listening to music way more often during the day simply because I enjoy it that much more. This is the reason I'm ultimately sticking with the M4s. And it's not a hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 are simply the best. If you're buying headphones to block out the sound of your partner playing annoying tiktok vids, this is the one to get. M4s have pretty good noise canceling too, but the Sony's are way better here imo. Bose sits between the XM5 and the M4s, maybe just a little better than the M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely with multiple meetings throughout the day so I've done extensive testing on all three models. In a nutshell if you don't have any special requirements, all of them do a great job. In quiet conditions I prefer the the M4 a little better than the others, my voice just has more body to it, but again, it's plenty clear using any of these models. In noisy conditions, the Sony XM5 are way better than the rest in isolating your voice and minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! The 700 and M4 handled the background noise a bit differently. My voice is clearer on the M4s in noisy conditions whereas the Bose cancel out more background noise at the cost of sacrificing clarity. When there's lots of noise, the Bose can reduce your voice to the point where it's super difficult to hear what you're saying. The M4s will allow more background noise through, but my voice remains super clear and louder than other sounds coming through.One feature I really like about the M4s, the one and only button they have (making it super easy to find) becomes a mute button during calls, zoom or google meetings. Really enjoy that feature as I could walk around the house and unmute myself if I need to talk. A voice tells you if it's muted or unmuted so you know where you're at. No more flushing the toilet while running out of the room hoping no-one on the meeting heard it.The background noise canceling of the XM5 during calls was so good, it made me really want to keep them. But ultimately good music sound quality is something I'd enjoy more often since I'm not often taking meetings in super noisy conditions. Also the M4s have the mute button I could use if I do find myself in that situation.Summery:If you want incredible noise cancelation while listening to music, taking calls or meetings, the Sony XM5 are the one to get. They are head and shoulders above the competition in this respect. If you wanna be wowed by how amazing your music sounds, renewing your love for music you didn't even know you had, the M4s are for you. These are the main areas where there is substantial difference. Sony and Seinheiser truly impressed me in their respective areas of expertise. Aside from those standout areas, these are all great headsets. Even the Bose 700 is a really solid headset. Unfortunately it wasn't able to differentiate itself when compared to these two titans of industry. Noise canceling is great, just can't touch the Sony's. Sound quality also great, just can't touch the M4s. Arguable the Bose are the slickest looking headset of the bunch though.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AEIK33PCH7JB7R3OI4CZJZPPNLDQ,True,88,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

RQIJ8796C2B2A,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Sound is top notch,NerdyCup,4,"TLDR; great sound with pretty good ANC.First, I'm not an audiophile. I appreciate music and sound more than just ""MOAR BASS"" but as to warmth, tonality, and terms like that, I'm lost. I do know having worn open back headphones those have a great sound space compared to closed back, but my wife can't stand hearing my music so it's closed back headphones for me.Positive:1. Great sound. Between these, some Senns 598s, true momentum earbuds, I've never not liked the sound Sennheiser produces. Earbuds were the weakest, but those were Momentum 2s and didn't last long when my dogs chewed on them (I understand Sennheiser has improved as well).1A. I cannot understate how good these sound - I literally can hear Chester Bennington pushing his breath out on ""Lost"", and instruments I've never picked up before. I can't recall other headsets doing that for me.2. Comfortable - immediately comfortable out of the box. Maybe warms up my ears a bit much, but the benefit is a solidly closed ""box"" for my ears to listen without distraction.3. Battery life appears to be as epic as they say it is. I haven't rocked it solid for 50+ hours to find out but I've charged it like once, when I first got it a few weeks ago (not constantly listening)Unknowns: need to test the ANC on an airplane/airport setting, which is my biggest pet peeve for noise environments. Will try to update (if I remember) once I do.Negatives:1. Touch controls in general. It's not just Sennheiser, but Sony and others im sure. I just don't really want to take the time to remember if it's a swipe, pinch, double-triple-quad tap to do something. KISS should be the rule of thumb. I can stumble through by tapping/swiping either side and eventually find something close to what I want, but I usually end up in the Sennheiser Smart Control App to make sure the ANC is what I want.Comparison:I also got a Sony WH-1000XM5 recently. Also a very good headphone, but the sound is absolutely not as good as Sennheiser. ANC is top of class though (although I also have t tried it in an airport/airplane, just in my commutes), and is better than Sennheiser, it's not as huge a gap as it used to be. We're comparing a Porsche and a BMW; should anyone turn either of them down? No.It comes down to your personal needs: lots of travel(air, train, whatever) in noisy environments? Maybe go with Sony, but I'd try the Sennheiser Momentum 4s first to see if their ANC works for you. IMO, the Sennheiser sound quality is much better than Sony's sound more than Sony's ANC is better than Sennheiser's.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGX5BT3OBJ4RMSQM7TVVOBQTPU4Q,True,4,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

R3V8FW19HBYSG7,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't touch them or they'll try to connect to everything,Customer Since 1997,3,"These headphones must have some kind of tilt sensor or other mechanism to know when they have been moved. If I am not using them and I accidentally touch them or they get bumped and move even slightly, they will suddenly try to connect to every device they are paired with, cutting off the sound from a random device I'm not currently using them with. They also seem to just randomly connect themselves to any device that is playing audio, cutting off the sound so that I have to go to that Bluetooth device's settings and disconnect them to get sound back. Very annoying.That aside, these are what I would call 'average' headphones. They're your typical V-shaped consumer sound that you'd get from any other dynamic headphone. They're bass heavy because your average consumer equates more base with more quality.Their noise cancellation is not particularly good. They seem to slightly lower the volume of some noises. In the areas where other noise canceling headphones excel such as repetitive or droning noises, these headphones seem to not work at all. For example, when I'm a passenger in a car I can clearly hear the noise of the air conditioner with the noise cancellation maxed out.There's also a problem with the touch surface on the earcup. I have turned off the touch features several times but they keep turning themselves back on. Every time I touch my face to scratch an itch or brush my hair out of my face I hear a PLOK and a random setting on the headphones has changed itself as if I have interacted with them. I have to dig my phone out in the middle of my exercise, figure out which setting was changed, and change it back.That's not to say that these headphones are all bad: I have tried many of the headphones in the ""fancy wireless headphones with noise canceling"" category over the years, and I'd have to say that in terms of comfort, these are the best. I can wear them for hours while exercising with minimal discomfort.That said, they do have some rattling and creaking issues that I would not expect at this price point. There's an unusual amount of plastic material on these headphones that I would not expect on a premium noise canceling headphone. While other brands are using lovely brushed aluminum supports for the earcups, these headphones have stuck with the creaky plastic with clearly visible mold lines.To summarize, I would say that these headphones are sort of the odd person out: They do not excel at anything, but they are not particularly bad at anything, either. Senheiser seems to have targeted to produce a headphone that provides middle-of-the-road performance in all areas, and in that capacity they have succeeded.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AER3H6YXKFEFRVUVRRMSWOQFE42A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Firstly, the connection gets choppy sometimes, and I don't know why. It often requires restarting the headset to fix. Another issue is that the quietest volume is not quiet enough. Listening to music in bed at night, it's just too loud in such an otherwise quiet environment. Also the auto-off/wake feature is way too sensitive. I'll leave it on my desk, come back later, and just bumping the desk makes it turn back on which often I don't want.

I have fairly average-sized ears, and the earcups barely cover the lobes, which is great for passive noise cancellation, but I did have to adjust the headband quite a bit. In comparison, the Airpods have a self-adjusting system similar to my wired AKG K712 i.e., the headband will adjust to your head size.3. Plasticky compared to the Apple's metal frame. It's kind of like my AKG vs. my Beyerdynamic. In terms of build quality feel, 'you get what you pay for'.Comfort:1. Earpads: this is what most travelers will care about. Like with any headphone, I adamantly recommend everyone review manufacturer site, legitimate review sites, etc. The Sennheiser M4 has pleather pads as you can tell. No need to say that they'll get hot after a while - common knowledge. Grado loses here for obvious reasons, then the Sennheiser, then the Beyerdynamic, and finally the winner the Airpods. Apple was smart in using mesh - breathable and lightweight.2. Headband: this is not as big a deal as earpads. None of the test headphones were terrible, but some were still better than others. The Sennheiser uses a medium with pleather band covered by fabric, which looks nice. In a huge switcheroo, Grado wins with their thin industrial band, followed by Apple's thin metal, then the Sennheiser, and finally the Beyerdynamic with their high-end but a little too thick leather curve.Sound and Noise cancellation:1. Obviously, a wired headphone connected to a top end USB DAC will beat any wireless one, but both the Apple and Sennheiser did well here. And they still cost less than the Beyerdynamic to boot.2. Neither wired headphones are noise cancelling nor do they claim to be, but being semi-closed/open, you would think the Beyerdynamic might do ok, but no joy.3. Both the Apple and Sennheiser are very good at noise cancellation, but not perfect, but the Apple was clearly better, even with all Sennheiser settings at max.Accessories:1. This is a fun one. Apple being Apple, gives you jack (no pun intended). An USB C to Lightning cable, infamous bra case.2. Sennheiser, meanwhile, gives you an outdated (haven't seen these in years) airplane double connector, 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, USB C to A cable, and finally a nice cloth case (my color combo was gray).3. Additional note: wired headphones, being wired, both the Grado and Beyerdynamic gave 3.5mm to 6.3mm audio adapters. Being a high-end model, the T1 also came with a case.Final thoughts:1. I normally don't use wireless headphones, at most, a Bluetooth amp, the aforementioned USB DAC and one of my usual wired cans. But my brother convinced my to try a pair for an upcoming trip. They really are convenient.2. The unfortunate thing I found in my search, as of this writing (9/30/2022), there are no modern (i.e., BT 5) really high-end e.g., T1 level wireless headphones out there. They all seem to top out around the $400 mark, which sounds a lot, but not for a ultra high end wired headphone.3. Of the 10 or so better choices out there, what I would recommend depends on your music style, phone, use/need. Loyal Apple users - Airpods Max, Android users - this Sennheiser M4, hardcore must have the best music quality users - wait - niche uber manufacturers are getting there.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2022",AFZQEWUCJEY5NLQE6XQY3QQ5WC3Q,True,36,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R15H50LMG3BLPJ,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars The premium headset to get,tlking4,5,"I've been looking to replace my Plantronics V8200 for years; I travel for work, take calls on both desktop and mobile, need a good microphone, often need solid noise cancellation, value comfort, and need convivence in charging, portability, and connectivity. The Momentum 4 checks all the boxes.Battery life is insane. Once charging cord (finally) is great. ANC is solid; no uncomfortable pressure or buzzing; and I took a flight while barely realizing we were on one.The folding and durability is nice and can easily carry these in a backpack with many other items. Extremely comfortable even for an 8hr session (and I wear glasses).I am far from an audiophile, but I have zero complaints about sound quality for calls, music, games, and movies. The in-app EQ is a good option. Mic quality is solid and have received zero complaints even on external customer calls.I was not expecting to like the touch controls. I do wish they were physical buttons, customizable, and on both earcups instead of just the right hand one. However, the actual experience (swipe up/down for volume, left/right for tracks, and tap to pause) is solid, with very few accidently presses. On-head detection worked perfectly. The physical button on the headset being a mute button while on a call is amazing, and this is detected in software on mobile (example being discord) and on desktop (WebEx mutes and unmutes itself in software when I press the button on the headset). This is amazing.The Multipoint connection (android phone and windows laptop) is very solid; notifications on the phone don't steal audio from a work call or vice versa. I do wish the headphone jack was a normal 3.5mm one instead of a smaller plug on the headset, then I wouldn't have to keep track of the adapter cord. Minor issue; very glad there is still a physical cable option along with the USB-C charging.Overall, this was the headset I was looking for and expect to run it for years.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHXNPP7TG2E73FWLT7L7PDVSH4XA,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R3IPWB05P9IKRT,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best All Over Ear Headphones,Customer Ed,5,"I’ve tried many over ear and in ear headphones, including the Sony WH-1000xm4 and xm5, apple AirPods Max, and other Sennheisers. Simply put, these are the best. These have enhanced my enthusiasm for listening to new music, and I love listening to old favorites with all the luxurious, crisp detail these headphones can reproduce. I’ve broken it down into the most important features to me:Sound Quality: I’m not audiophile, but I can say these sound far superior to any of the other over ears I’ve used. Sennheiser is known for its neutral, accurate sound, and these seem to be the best iteration of that sound. Soundstage is wide open with incredible spatial effects, instrument separation, and no notable coloration or boxy sound. Despite the clarity, the bass here is incredible. You can feel it, but in a natural way that really underpins the song. Strong, natural base and incredibly detailed throughout the frequency spectrum, I can’t wait to get these things on my ears all day long. Just a pure joy of a listening experience.ANC - very strong. Not quite as strong as the Sony, but not enough of a drop down. You won’t notice much of a difference between these and any of the “better” ANC headphones. Same goes for the transparency mode, which allows you to hear ambient noise when you switch it on.Battery life - 60 hours is insane, but in my experience I’m getting that with ANC on so the claims don’t seem to be exaggerated.Comfort: definitely a little heavier than my Sonys, but buttery smooth headband and even weight distribution make for comfortable, long listening sessions. May be a bit of adjustment period if you’re used to lighter cans, but certainly not as heavy as the AirPods Max.Touch controls: definitely take some getting used to at first. Double tap right ear cup to enable ANC or transparency, pinch in or out to change noise cancellation level (this control is wonky and very hard to use, so I just use adaptive ANC and let it do its thing). Tracks can be switched by swiping left or right, but this can be an adventure. Depending on the angle that they’re sitting on your head, it can be hard to swipe in the exact right direction. With some practice it gets better. Same goes for up and down for volume, and volume changes seem to occur depending on the length of your swipe, rather than in steady increments. This means getting it to your exact desired volume using touch controls can be difficult. Answering and ending calls is also done through swiping forward and back, so you can experience the same issues. Overall, not the most intuitive controls, but not a deal breaker and with time it becomes easier.Call quality: I keep these on while working and take phone calls. Through some testing, these provide much better voice pickup and clarity than any of my in ears or even the built in speaker phone. If I’ve got an important call, I know the person on the other line will hear every word if I’m using these. Switching between calls, music, and podcasts with these all day long, these are perfect. They also have multipoint connectivity, providing seamless switching between laptop and phone.Overall, these are the best over ears I’ve found for what I use them for. Music, podcasts, commuting, movies and tv shows, work calls. The highest praise I have for these is they have revived my love of music as they remind you how good music can sound when reproduced with clarity and detail.If you’ve got some deep pockets, I’d also pick up the Momentum true wireless 3 earbuds, to have that same beautiful sound during those times that full over ear headphones aren’t appropriate.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2022",AGORAFANRG5DE6BQM4JS3ZO3EAQA,True,47,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

One of the few ANC wireless you can plug in and use wired. I prefer these over a few other much more expensive cans I’ve tried.

However for whatever reason after an hour or two they hurt my ears - not sure if it’s sonic or ear cup size and shape.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AF2HFURXMWODMQPRLAYBZOTFPACQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1UEJPGVRZ9X65,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller cups than other Sennheiser - amazing anyway, read full review",George Fields,5,"You're a smart person, you can find the frequency response curves, ANC curves, etc. online. This review is about the overall experience. Note: I happen to LOVE the way these look, simple, plain, understated... smaller target for theft, too.I have the Sennheiser HD 515, HD 598, and HD 598 Cs, and the Sennheiser GAME ONE headset. Those (and most other from the brand) have large, extremely comfortable ear cups. I know that, and need that, because I used to play World of Warcraft for about 50 hours a week, with headphones all the time.First impression—the cups are smaller. It just so happens that I have normal ears, and the other Sennheisers I have are too big for me, with a good margin to adjust them when the skin gets tired around my earlobes. The MOMENTUM 4 surprised me by being smaller, but—they have a really good design and are concave, with more space inside the cup than it seems, especially in the back. I am able to find a few different positions where my earlobes are not pressed (or even touched) at all, but how they fit you will depend on your ears, which is something important to consider.The review at SoundGuys is on point. The M4 do have a bit more low end than my other sets, and I like that; it's easier to EQ your way down than up. Overall very happy with the sound, I don't think you'd be disappointed. As the SG review says, the ANC is a little weak sometimes; I don't care, to me that's secondary.Battery life is amazing, the 60hrs claim seems accurate. Build quality is plasticky and okay, I would baby them a bit. Touch controls are precise and responsive for me, even with the guide stickers still on the outside (which I've removed after my wife made fun of me for it). The app seems to work all right, I think it's better to set your preferences and then not use it anymore, as sometimes the settings get changed around a bit for no reason. (KEEP UP WITH FIRMWARE UPDATES, though.)Connectivity—outstanding. Bluetooth (multipoint x2), passive mode, and USB mode. Quickly: * Bluetooth: works fine. Good range, it seems. I don't care for or like the multipoint, and I think it's irrelevant. * USB mode: use USB-A to USB Type C cable (included). Headphone presents as a regular USB headset to the computer. Works great and charges at the same time. * Passive mode: Uses a 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable (included) to use as a plain Jane wired headset. You CAN power on the M4 in this mode and benefit from better sound, or leave them off (on purpose, or if the battery is dead). I DISAGREE THAT THE SOUND IS BAD IN PURE PASSIVE MODE, WITH POWER OFF. It's slightly subpar compared to BT/USB/powered passive, but it's JUST FINE, and pretty good to boot.The SG review docks the M4 on mic quality, but in my tests people's feedback was that the calls were clear and noise-free, even when I was doing yard work on a very windy day. Still, YMMV.Case—it's a carrying case. It's... functional, plain, the way I like my coffee.My only complaint, if this tells you anything—the charge port and 2.5mm port are on the RIGHT cup, whereas all other sets I've ever had or seen have the cable going to the LEFT one. The power button and touch controls are also on the RIGHT, so maybe that's why, but on the (infrequent) occasions when you may have a cable attached, it's not where you'd be used to finding it.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2023",AGORTA25R56MRPEW236JMI3XD25Q,True,111,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2DR9OKGN9HSJV,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wired Mode is sometimes totally bugged. Manufacturer defect.,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this pair about a month ago, and when i got it out of the box to explore the features, I noticed some serious issues; the bluetooth latency is terrible for gaming, and in wired mode (to reduce latency), sometimes the sound is ruined.I'm a gamer, and I like to play a lot of PUBG, so I need great sound, AND I need low sound latency, I noticed that in bluetooth mode, the latency is just too high. Like ~100 ms high. Maybe this can be improved to like 40 ms with the right bluetooth controller, but I really want ~5 ms.When I first got it, and I tried to use wired mode (and stumbled upon the 2.5mm jack, had to buy new cables. Wtf is wrong with you. >:C), the sound quality was trashed. I don't mean ""bad"" like some picky audiophile. I mean TRASHED. I can hardly describe how bad it is, it's like the volume is dropped by 30 db, and for some reason only a few narrow bands of frequency manage to make it through, making some noises come through orders of magnitude louder than others. It's just this unlistenable murky mess. No exaggerationThis problem persisted for like 3 days, and it all of a sudden went away for no reason. It worked just fine for a whole month, (and I adored the sound quality) and now the problem has come back for no reason. What the hell is this? I noticed that if I back out the jack on my DAC by ~1/16 inch, I get decent sound quality IN MONO. Unacceptable. Factory resetting the headphones did nothing. A firmware update did nothing. Restarting my computer? nothing. Shutting off all bluetooth? Nothing.The other features are fine. Maybe I felt like the bass was comparatively weak to my old bassy cans, but I got used to it.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AGGGNM37DWTLZE7UPYKWPFJCCBCQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R11QF4OKPIM01C,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wait For The Next Version,J.C.,3,"The ANC was incredible, the battery life was amazing, everyone could hear my voice on calls, they were comfortable, connected over Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm for audio (with one mini end, which was kind of silly), and they came with a nice case.The construction felt decent enough to me, although, it is definitely not the metal build many come to expect from Sennheiser.Audio quality was a little muddy in my opinion, using it mostly to listen to synthwave music and watching Dolby ATMOS content via PLEX. The app certainly didn't let me dial things in, which may have been why things didn't sound amazing. Overall, it was just okay.So, what's not great? The app on Android is awful, the headphones would sometimes cut out to a loud static, or pick up RF interference, and the touch controls are awful and easily activated by tilting your head. Also, there's no ""Lossless"" option for hi-res audio and you need a separate dongle to use on your PC (and still can't use it as a gaming headset without it stepping down to AM radio quality I/O).Once the new Bluetooth codec standards for lossless 16-bit / 44.1kHz come out, and once you can pair to networks and some of the new protocols coming out in the next few years, I would be curious to see if Sennheiser revises this and fixes the issues I've mentioned.It's very close, but it's just not worth the asking price. Maybe on a sale, or if you're okay with being limited by the codecs available.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AGX4NRDWLOEZF64P7JCMFL3CU5IQ,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
ROYKDE0H8KYE6,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite wireless headphones,mariah kemmerer,5,"You can use them while charging - all other arguments are obsolete.Lol but no seriously, not only do these have a crazy long battery life you can also use them while they are plugged in charging. I'm a simple woman with simple needs, but even the Sony M5 can't do that.I had been debating between these and the Sony 1000XM5 and had even purchased the M5. But I had to immediately return them. I'm not sure what it is with Sony and their terrible sizing. They were just too big and loose. Thankfully, Sennheiser has never disappointed and the fit of the Momentum 4 is great. As a general consumer (not a self-proclaimed audiophile) I found these very comparable in build and material to the Sony M5.Coming from always wearing open-back Sennheisers there is a drop in sound quality, but (!) that is expected and I don't find that a detractor. They still sound great. I think the Sony M5 had a bit more of a clearer sound, and the Momentum 4 has a bit too much bass out of the box - but with a little tweaking in the Sennheiser app, I found a happy spot. Noise-canceling is good - I wouldn't say top of its class, but I haven't found myself ever thinking ""gee, I wish they blocked out more noise."" And once I turn on music or a video I don't notice any background noise even in busy places.The mic is okay. I don't really use it, so it's not on my priority list - but if it is for you the Sony M5 outclasses these by a mile on mic quality.The Bluetooth connection works well for me and has a good range. But there can be some drawbacks if you're switching between more than 2 devices regularly. Between my iPad and iPhone, these headphones connect great, and audio will bounce back and forth between them pretty seamlessly. When only 2 devices are connected, they will always be connected and you don't have to do anything to switch between them. BUT once you add a third device you have to start regularly opening the app. You MUST have the app. Because I connected my iPad and phone first, after the headphones get turned on it will auto-connect to those 2 devices (regardless of what it was last connected to). When I first connected these headphones to my computer I couldn't understand why there was no audio and the sound settings were stuck on mute. Fun fact - you have to go into the app and open up the connection manager and toggle on the device you want to use. Only two devices can be toggled on at once. I have to do this every time I want to use these with my computer - because as I said it will revert to my iPad and phone automatically. Not a dealbreaker - but a pain in the ass.Touch controls. I don't hate them. I had a pair of older Bluetooth Sony's with touch controls and absolutely hated them. Bane of my existance. But I find these controls a lot better thought out and executed. I don't accidentally hit them and once I fiddled with the control options in the app (you can customize what some touches do) I really like being able to double-tap between ambient and noise canceling.Overall I really like these headphones and am very happy I returned the Sony M5 and grabbed these.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2022",AHMZTM2ZRR7O2HALQIPM7OE2UQUA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I don't use full ANC, but the battery lasts for multiple 8-10 hour work days. The headphones are comfortable to wear all day and I don't notice any problems with the clamping pressure or the weight of the headphones sitting on top of my head. The sound quality is great, if you take some time to fine tune the EQ settings. They are also aesthetically pleasing for what it's worth.Most of the problems seem to be software related. Bluetooth switching between phone and laptop is pretty ok but at least once per day my headphones will connect to my phone and I need to shut off the phone bluetooth to get audio from my laptop. Also, there is no ""regular"" mode for the ANC, meaning that you either get the amplified sound outside of the headphones, or can feel the ANC working. There needs to be a setting that turns both off and gives the regular amount of muffling over ear headphones would normally provide. I also despise the fact that I need to use the Sennheiser app on my phone to control EQ or amount of ANC, why not make a simple desktop app that can do the same?","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AFKOEAETUFFKKOLH7WK5CIUZCF4A,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
RTN9WQR625T86,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars What you need to know...,Randall Whitted,5,"Before buying these, you gotta know some things. First, if you listen to earbuds a lot, over-ear headphones sound different. The sound is less directly in your ear, and more around you. As such, there is less impact. That doesn't mean these aren't good, they're just not shoved into your ear.Second, the source makes or breaks these. A crappy source will sound crappy on these and you'll end up blaming the headphones. It's actually a feature of the headphones though. They reproduce what you put into them very well. Go into Spotify and mess with the EQ there if you feel the need. I like sharp treble and got it that way. Change the stream setting to highest quality. Plug them into a good digital to analog converter (DAC). Try different sources and you'll see whatever you may not be liking is not the headphones. As an acoustic guitarist, I was hoping for the same sound I get with my Martin on my lap. I'd love to have headphones that sound like Tony Rice and Dave Grisman are standing on either side of me, but that's not gonna happen. Again, the source matters. These headphones are not a hand-built American acoustic guitar played by a master standing next to you, but they'll sound more like it than the majority of headphones.Third, we've become programmed to in-your-face sound. These Momentum 4 are very much ""grown-up"" headphones. They articulate. They detail. The present. But they don't floor you with over-the-top sound all through the range. There are plenty of good, inexpensive headphones and earbuds that will pop your eardrums. I personally recommend Anker for that. My Space A40 earbuds are awesome, but when I A/B tested the A40 and these Momentum 4, I realized there were instruments I didn't even realize were there when listening with the A40 earbuds.Fourth, the bluetooth is dumb at first. From what I can tell, they won't work like you'd expect until you launch the app as part of the connection process. It's fine though. Just don't give up on them right off the bat because of that.Other random thoughts - they're super UNcomfortable right away, become very comfortable rather quickly - like within minutes. Also, good headphones do have a break-in period, and these are no exception. Be sure to try the wired connection on some different sources as well. MacBooks have good DACs in them. Anker makes a good USB-C to aux adapter with a DAC in it. The bluetooth connection can sound pretty dang good though. And the microphones in this headset are almost creepy-good. Also, bluetooth range is perfectly fine. I went three rooms away in my house with no issues at all.Summary - I was thinking of returning these, but I know Sennheiser so I messed with settings and connections and I'm glad I did. They're great headphones, but the key is to remember - if your source is crap, they will faithfully reproduce that crap.","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023",AEJWET4WAUKOAUJKFYEZSZKWTTNA,True,104,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2GC7X8P84LSAI,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost excellent,Lloyd,4,"After much research I decided on these. I chose them for the positive reviews and the good price pint. I really like the look as well. I purchased them in white. After receiving them I quickly downloaded the app and got stated. As many have said, the app isn’t always great. Sometimes, it doesn’t connect properly and it really annoying. I am not an audiophile or a tech person but these sound great. I use the podcast setting constantly. Music sounds pretty amazing. I also love the intuitive touch controls. I looked at the manual online and watched a ton of videos to make sure I was optimizing the features. They are pretty comfortable. The ear cups actually don’t bother me when I have earrings in or glasses on which is great. The headpiece is very soft and luxurious feeling. The automatic pause and restart is awesome when it works. Then only issue with this is that if I take them off and lay them down and do not turn them off, when you go to play something Bluetooth’d to another device, it’s will often just play on you headphones that are laying down somewhere no not on your head. The ANC is just ok. I bought these because I stupidly knocked my Bose off of my head while cleaning the pool. They still work after much drying but they don’t last long on the charge. These are nowhere near the ANC of the Bose or even AirPod Pros. I have not used the SONYs so I cannot compare those. However, I am fine with them being just ok in this feature as I use them outside to walk and run and kind of would like to be able to hear what’s going on around me without having full traffic noise. Here are my issues…..first off, every phone call that comes in, when I answer it with headphones on….it immediately disconnects the call. It works fine if I call out. I have noticed this is a problem as evidenced on messages boards but there doesn’t really seem to be much of a solution. I contacted the company to see if they. Had a solution. Their response? Just return them to Amazon, as they have a better return policy in the Sennheiser Amazon store. The return policy is 30 days. Mind you….I purchased them March 24, and my original email was sent March 29. Today is April 24. Thus, leaving me no time to return them (I DID tell them in my email when I purchased them). I asked two questions and they didn’t address the one above at all. Really unhappy with the customer service for a $300 product. So, if you’re a tech and figure out whatever issue you have; great. their wise maybe look somewhere that has better customer service.

I had a few Sennheiser headsets over the years, and this one is major disappointment. I bought it because PXC550 was aging and I always wanted to buy momentum, because it was considered higher product line.1. Design - it is step back from original Momentum. If I wanted Sony I could buy Sony. I bought this headset because I like the brand, but design...why not copy iPods? Dumb.2. Comfort- clamping action is much stronger then PXC550 or Sony XM5(tried in store). Pads relatively hard and ears sometimes do not fit well.3.

I am comparing them to old model of PXC550.On/OFF functionality - why not to keep same function when cups are flat headset is off when turned in listening position headset is ON. With this headset you never know if the are on or off. Reviewers say ""it is not a problem because headset has large battery life"" - this is most dumb excuse you can come up with.Tap to Play/Pause - some times it works some times it does does not.

Why not to keep same functionality as on older headsets each volume change would respond with the sound.ANC- What ANC? most reviewers say it is slightly worse then Sony ... they are lying it is pretty much worse then anything I had, including $30 Chinese junk. This gesture adjustment does not really work, double tap sometimes work some times does not. On maximum ANC I still hear voices and passing cars. However it does cancel the wind which is good.4. Sound - Ok sound is not really bad. It is well balanced and has just a few more details then other headsets I tried Not within same price range, but within same consumer class I could hear background singer on one of the songs. It is louder then PXC550 which is good, but balance and detail is pretty much the same. This headset has no Stage at all. Sound lucking ""WOW"" feeling, it is pretty flat.I noticed this headsets has random disconnects. not really bad, but still worth to mention.I am still thinking about returning it, or keep it for few more days to see if they grow on me.I would say price (250) is pretty good for what you get.if you never had anything better it would be good headset for the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AGFPE3TGGCHH7S4DE5Z7HZ7ZCAUA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3BCMJ8RYR5L76,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Was I just maybe expecting too much?,Giratina,3,"Based on other reviews I decided to pick these up and the btd600 dongle meant to go with it for pc etc, Honestly im pretty disappointed. First the anc may as well not exist as it blocks nothing even when set to max or adaptive, can still hear everything as if its right next to me. Second the sound quality sounds... not sure how to describe it but maybe muddy or sounding like you're listening through a barrier. The headphones also struggle to handle intense songs like edm without distorting any voices while there is any bass and almost vibrates the voice causing it to sound off (ive tested tons of eq settings). Using them wired doesn't seem to fix the quality issue either. The bass itself is fine though once adjusted depending on the song speed. The touch controls turn back on every time you turn these off even when set to off on every device you have it connected to. Comfort wise they do start to bend and hurt your ears after a while requiring constant adjusting. Overall I'm pretty disappointed for something in the $300+ range as they sound like other $100 headphones. There's a chance maybe mine is broken but the hassle of swapping them isn't worth it.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AG5Y4LSKJTORYYBYUOJ3IBGIC2LQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1OLFI88OUFMZ9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Best in class!,Shelby Yale Marr,5,"I went to BestBuy to get my hands on a few of the top contenders. Sony XM5, Bose 700, and a few others not worth mentioning. They did not have a Sennheiser momentum 4 in the store for demo, they had to be ordered. The battery life of the Sony and the Bose were better than the others they had available in store. The sound quality was good. The materials felt cheap some more than others. I did not care for the skinny headband on some of them. After trying them out, I went on Amazon’s website and ordered the Sennheiser momentum 4. The 60 hour battery life, and fast charging is amazing. The noise canceling is excellent, I work with a lot of heavy equipment, it is loud all the time. I have used them on several long flights for both music from my phone or my tablet, or the airplanes movie selection. Several of the flights had very loud and obnoxious children, the noise canceling and good volume level made it much more pleasant. The build quality of the Sennheiser momentum 4 feels much more premium than the Sony or the Bose. The sound quality and clarity is unmatched to anything that I have tried, as far as wireless headphones. The frequency response is incredible with the 42 mm drivers. The gesture controls are intuitive, and very easy to use and get used to. I can wear them for hours my head does not get tired or sore. Everyone that I have come across that has tried them wants to set for themselves. Using them at work I often have multiple phone calls, there are gestures you can use on the side control to swap between calls. The microphones built into the headset pick up your voice clearly and eliminate background noise and wind for very clear calls. They are great for short sessions, but also long sessions as I have worn them for over 12 hours in a row. I wear glasses and they do not bother me while wearing glasses. I have had them for nearly a year. The battery life is still very strong. You can go on vacation and not have to charge the headphones until you return. I had a pair of Brookstone noise, canceling headphones years ago. When they eventually failed, I picked up a pair of Sony noise, canceling headphones. The Sony’s eventually failed as well. I replaced them with Bose they were wired the wire deteriorated very rapidly. Replaced them with a set of Bose earbuds, they are handy, but for a long flight the Sennheiser’s are definitely the way to go. Amazing sound quality. Transparency mode is also a very handy feature. Double tap the side of the headphone to activate or deactivate transparency mode so you can hear what is going on around you. The ability to lift the ear cup to pause playback is very handy. They also power down when you place them in the very nice case.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AGXNT7BE4PKZY7LPRQ5IMFXHPLTQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2UYH59HBOTDSC,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent pair of headphones,Tyler,4,"I already had plans to buy these but after my Sennheiser CX wireless earbuds took a tumble in the washer, I kinda had to get these. I was already aware of the numerous issues that people had with these headphones but after having these for 2 weeks, I never ran into any of them.First Impression- Overall really like the look of these with the fabric headband and an all-around clean look. A little plasticky feeling but it isn't the kind of cheap plastic you would find on inexpensive headphones.Sound Quality- Now I'm not a big headphone person or audiophile guy but to me, these sound great and are probably one of the best-sounding over-ear wireless headphones I've ever owned. Super clear sound and very good bass.Call Quality- Mic is what you’d expect. Not the best but it's good enough for calls. I was able to hear clearly from people on the other end and they heard me on the other end perfectly fine. Side-Tone works great too however I don't like hearing myself so I keep it off.ANC-It really isn't that bad, although it doesn't match the quality that Sony headphones have, it's enough to water out most sounds around you however lower frequencies tend to pass through.App and Controls-The app is super easy to navigate through with a lot of settings to choose from. One of these settings would be an equalizer so you can mess around and find your own preferred sound configuration. Touch controls definitely took some time to get used to but they are very reactive to touch and I don't think you’ll need to do any double tapping. You can also disable touch controls if you don't like them. To address pairing issues, I had absolutely none. Might be different for you since I do still see these complaints every now and then.Comfort-Comfort is something that comes down to preference and to me, these were very comfortable on my head. I have a very large head so I had to adjust these to the max and they fit super well. Ear cups are nice and soft and the padding on the headband is firm on the sides and super squishy on the top. Overall super comfy on my head and I’ve yet to run into any issues with discomfort.Battery Life-Battery life is also pretty great too. 60 hours of battery life is more than plenty and can last you a whole week depending on how often you use them.Overall I think these are great all-around headphones that are great for daily use and travel. Of course, these do have some issues but they don't bother me enough to not recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AEQT6ADH6CI7LIAZKS2DH2DKTMFA,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2QVBA1G7PUXO9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Love 'em,David,5,"Comfortable. Intuitive touch controls. Battery life. Design.Prior to purchase I did lots of research (thank you early adopters that do video reviews and websites that do qualitative reviews). I purchased these over other similarly priced brands based on the available features, price and design style. I have no remorse for the price I have paid.A little more depth:First, sound was a big priority for me -- I wanted a pair of headphones that reproduced sound/music as closely as an original artist may have desired. I found a website, soundguys.com, that provided a frequency-response (an audio-sweep starting from the 10's of Hz to the 10's of kHz is played through the headphones then the output noise difference is measured) graph for the headphones showing a very good sound reproduction (compared to a similarly priced set of Sony headphones these were more true to the input audio sweep).Second was design. I am a big fan of having the cups of the headphones attached to the headband via the swiveling 'pitch fork' design. Mounted/affixed to the middle of the/a headphone-cups. From an engineering/physics perspective, this means the pushing/pressing force exerted by the headband through the cups is centered from the middle of the cups, as opposed to the tops of the cup's--which invariably results in the pushing pressure being more towards the top of the cups (assumptions based on the XM5's design).Third. Comfort. The somewhat flat headband with its padding is forgettable and the pressure it supplies to the cups to the sides of one's (average size) head is sufficient -- maybe a little on the lite side. Also, the inside (head side) of the headband is a rubbery-like material, so no fears of hair/scalp oils dirtying a fabric there.Lastly, a subjective review of the sound, ANC, and call quality. I think the sound is amazing! The ANC is super cool. I've worn these on public transit (daily on the bus, and weekly on the train) and finally feel like I won't have any hearing damage from having to listen to the drone of the engine or cabin noise. You will still have some awareness of sounds around you, especially those of higher pitch/tone, but if you have music going (half volume for me) you will not hear any thing. Pass-through mode is also quite nice, though sometimes other's voices may sound quite (again, due to using half volume).Call quality is great. I held a phone call wherein I had a fan blowing on my head (wind noise). Neither I or my caller could hear any of the noise from the fan.Since owning the headphones, Sennheiser has released a firmware update for the ANC. Before and after the update I cannot empirically say I've notice any difference. Knowing Sennheiser will push updates to further improve the product is also reassuring (though for this price point, I believe most companies are doing this).Several sites/videos say that a similarly priced set of Sony's has better ANC than these, but I'll argue that you don't need a pair of Sony's to enjoy/receive a similar experience!Very subjective final thought: These (in white) look better than the competition.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AFESKG7TMN4LQ6DRVCIB355WIX5Q,True,15,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RJOEYU7BI5AO4,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars While these sound fantastic, unfortunately the bad overpowers the good",ThereAreOrangesEverywhere,3,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser headphones for years and I have several other wired headphones from them that I've used for years as well. After reading up on the current wireless headphone offerings from various companies I decided to buy these since I already trusted the brand and the reviews were shining.I'm an audiophile hobbyist with a large head that makes most headphones become uncomfortable after a short amount of time being worn. I also have small ears and most in-ear headphones either don't fit at all or slip out within the first 10 minutes. I have some Airpod Pros that I sometimes use, but these also slip out from my ears constantly. The Sennheiser Momentum 4's fit better than a lot of headphones I've had, however after about 30 minutes of use, they become uncomfortable for me. If they just extended out a little further I don't think that would be an issue, but they don't. I wish more headphone companies made their headphones with greater expandable options, but oh well. If you're reading this and also had the large-head problem, I have a pair of AKG K 702as that I've used for a decade and they're very comfortable.The comfort is not the main issue though. It's the software to manage the headphones, and also the software/firmware on the headphones themselves. It has trouble connecting to the headphones consistently. The headphones also would frequently (and randomly) disconnect while listening to music on my iPhone. It was incredibly frustrating, and after reading through some forums I found that it was due to more than one device being in the headphones ""Devices"" list (my wife tried these on her phone at one point). Even though the other device was not actively trying to connect and even had Bluetooth completely off, the issue was happening a lot. Once I removed the 2nd device through the app, the connectivity issues went away.That is not my main complaint with the headphones though. The ANC cannot be turned off. You can adjust it to your hearts content from full blast ANC to full transparency, but ANC is on at all times. That's not necessarily a deal breaker, but for some reason the ANC on these cans gave me instant headaches. I tried researching why this could be happening and how to reduce this, and since these headphones have some adaptive ANC capabilities I tried listening outside, in an empty room, in a car, downtown, etc. - and it always gave me a headache.If the app let you disable ANC entirely I would have gladly kept them. The sound is fantastic, especially for the price. The bass is very rich, the mids are clean and the highs are crisp without being shrill. The soundstage is extremely impressive given these are closed back. I would have thought these cost at least twice what they do on the sound alone. The battery is also super impressive, these lasted almost two weeks of daily use before I had to charge them.Sennheiser is a sound company, not a software company. If they are going to force managing features of their headphone into an app, they really need to build out the app better and have options as simple as turning on/off ANC. While I'm all for new technology and software (I work as a software engineer), I'm more old-school with devices like this specifically for this reason. If these cans had a few actual buttons or switches to toggle ANC and some other basic features instead of relying on an app and swipe gestures, I'd keep them forever.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2023",AEVMPVH3K5FBJXFMQMM6YAPNDNUA,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RONNQB3KB0IWS,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones and extraordinary battery but iOS app did not work.,PMJ,4,"I received these headphones and put them on my head and they immediately paired with my iPhone (14 Pro Max). Touch controls are a little tricky but they do work. Sound is warm, balanced and very pleasant. I have a large head and the headphones feel comfortable covering my ears correctly. They seem to be light and well balanced. Sound is well balanced without being bass heavy or 'lumpy' with excellent detail on all the types of music to which I listen (mainly jazz, classical, electronic jazz and fusion with classic pop thrown in). I have yet to compare with the direct wired connect or via USB. Probably the best noise reduction headphones I have heard and are much smoother than the Sony XM4 and XM5 and less processed than the Bose QC 45s.The iOS app did not work. I installed it after the headphones had paired with my iPhone (as instructed by the instructions), started the app which showed that they had connected but when I tapped the headphone icon, it said it had not connected and I had to power off and remove the headphones from the bluetooth list on my phone. I performed the necessary changes and tried again with no success. I tried this 5 or 6 times with the same results. I gave up and tried a number of other strategies. I reset the headphones, deleted and reinstalled the app all to no avail.The headphones sound great but the inconvenience of trying to configure them manually is less helpful so I decided to send them back.Update 1: I also have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) and tried the installation of the app on that phone. BT pairing was more problematic but once paired the app worked correctly. I reset the headphones using the app (deleting the BT pairing list) and updated the headphones firmware. After doing this I tried again on the iPhone and it worked correctly this time. I am not sure whether it was the complete reset to factory settings or the updated firmware but it now appears to work on both iOS and Android.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AGTBK447OV5VAYFLVLFCMC3NOCDA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RW0GW7VS1ML79,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Punching WAY above their price point but have several unfortunate annoying features,Jordan Sage,4,"I have recently trued out a number of headphones across a variety of price points (e.g., the HifiMan Arya Stealth, B&W PX7, B&O H95). These beat out all the headphones that cost more than double. They were the most engaging of the wireless 'phones to listen to and the ones I wanted to keep coming back to. The are fun and energetic sounding, and are pretty generous in sound quality across the timbres. There is nothing these do that stands out sound-wise as super great - but no great sins anywhere either, and I did not find another bluetooth headphone that had such a good, balanced whole-picture sound like these do.I did, however, almost return these.The bluetooth interrupted several important business calls with no prompting from me whatsoever (and again, I had a half dozen Bluetooth headphones by my phone and none of them automatically interrupted more than 10-15 minutes into a call - totally unprompted - like these did).The other issue is that Sennhieser tried, I suppose, to get fancy with the touch controls on the side of the Right can. The issue with this is, if you touch or rest them against anything, the buttons will go off haphazardly. No other headphone I tested had any such issue. If you even lift these to scratch your ear, they will shut off or do something unintended. The good thing though is when you are ready to listen, you put them on your head and they will synch near instantaneously and be ready to play music. That's cool. But I am learning to live with all the unwanted features and touch activation of these.Altogether, I don't believe anything will touch these at the price point, and you would be hard-pressed to find many options under $1,000 that don't require an amplifier that will either. The feature set is annoying and intrusive. The design is bland and cheap looking. But they are comfortable to wear and they sound great. I guess that is just enough.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2023",AGUUYWB4JEORCZRCDA47JC4J2OQA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R1ZBIQTOJ15PHY,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars But are they, are they really?",Lost_And_Confused,3,"I am really hesitant to write a review in light of how many people have left reviews that sound like they would give their first born for these things. I am not in that camp. I have several sets of over-the-ear and in-ear headsets including the Apple Airpod Max and the new Sony MX5. Having used equipment from Senn for 30 years, I am familiar with their products and how their philosophy, so many others, has changed over that time with a leaning towards mass market. Oh, I get it...make money or close the doors. All that said, here is my real world experience. Upon opening them, I like the case, the wired adapter, etc. The headset is lightweight and very comfortable, even when wearing with glasses. That said, they are the ""cheapest looking/feeling"" headset from Senn I have ever seen...they really feel like cheap plastic crap...but that is not why you buy a headset. Just setting expectations here. The battery life claim of 60 hours is absolutely comical - I have been getting more around 12 hours (calls/music/online meetings - almost all with ANC). The ANC itself is not at the level of Apple or Sony. It works, and I have been on a couple flights with them. There does not seem to be any background noise filtering on the microphone side though - certainly not on par with Apple or Sony, though the ANC works well enough for the wearer. Max volume is lower than other brands, if that is important to you, but certainly loud enough. Bass response is significantly BETTER than Apple or Sony, though the sound quality as a whole is muddier with less staging than others. The pairing has been fairly smooth - no where as seamless as say the Airpod Max's if you are in an Apple ecosystem, but on par with most other brands. The app is a bit pointless, but given that the single button and touch controls arent the greatest, it is helpful. For example, the pinching/reverse-pinching to engage ANC sort of works...? I did have my first pair of these die after about 10 hours of use - would no longer pair and the lights just did a non stop light show - but got them replaced through Amazon without issue, as I had them only 2 days. Conclusions? Given that the Apple product is always on sale for $100 off, the price point between all three products (The Sony MX5's, the Airpod Max's and these) are within $100 of each other, I would have a hard time recommending these to friends or family. I really cannot find a single compelling reason to select these over competing products. I mean, they are bad by any means, just bland. They don't stand out from a looks, sound, ANC, build quality, functionality, or any other way...they work, well enough, and in the class they are in they are fairly priced. I honestly feel you could do better with the Apple Airpod Max if you are a big Apple user or the Sony MX5's otherwise - and be happier with either of those versus these. In fact, if plastic, lower quality builds, but with good sound, good bass response and decent ANC is your thing, you could do better with the over the ear model from Status Audio and save a couple hundred bucks. Of course, all of the above is my personal opinion, not paid, no free samples, no fancy audio test equipment...YMMV.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2022",AFYGCCFUGZL6PNRESNIUYWDTPMJQ,True,30,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R3T563LHCTJ4N1,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Love the headphones except for the garbled noise at times!!!!,azsteve01,4,"Sennheiser headphones have been my main headphones for watching TV since 2016 when i purchased the RS-175 wireless headphones. Roku has created a Private Listening mode and you cannot switch from headphone to tv/soundbar speakers easily since Roku disabled the TOSLink/headphone jack when you are using the Dolby sound hardware. A solution was needed and since you can connect to the soundbar via bluetooth the decision was made to find a bluetooth headphone that met my standards. Because of my loyalty to Sennheiser headphones the Momentum 4 were chosen.As stated Roku has created a Private Listening feature that makes it hard to use wire/fibre connection and bluetooth is the best solution to resolve the issues making it easier to switch between speakers and headphones.Major Issue:The only main issue with the Momentum 4 headphones is when you first connect, the sound is garbled for 5 to 10 seconds. You can either wait for the sound to clear up (annoying) or restart the video which can be a pain. Youtube and Plex are my main video apps i use and with youtube having to restart the videos each time gets old fast. The garbled sound is the same no matter what firmware is used.Minor issues:When you have the Momentum 4 connected to the app (iPhone) every time you are disconnected from the TV/Soundbar you have to use the app to reconnect. This is not convenient if the phone is not near. Unfortunately Roku has decided to disconnect any bluetooth connected after 5 minutes of idle time to save battery power on the headphones. This is not a Momentum 4 issue but reconnecting with the app make this cumbersome. Because of this problem the app is not being used at all and the headphones are set to factory default.The fit is not as good as the RS-175, ear cups need to be bigger.Pros:Excellent Sound, Long Battery Life, Noise Cancelling (even cancels out conversations), Touch Features, Light WeightI would recommend these to others but only if Sennheiser fixes the garbled issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2023",AHVWXOJUZYGFL7XQW5OY73KHERGQ,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R30434Q2LI61Q,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars great sound, cancellation and battery but . . .",mike,5,"I decided on these because of the reviews. And price was right for me.Here is my honest opinion. Sound is awesome, and noise cancelling is good. The special features (like headphone turn off and on as you take them off and on. Side ear swipe controls and sennheiser app for more controls) Well . . . if they work . . . it is very nice. You can only run the app through your phone. So that is a drawback. I found the swipe controls don't hardly work unless you are using the app itself. So if I have music say on amazon music unlimited through my laptop none of the feature work well, or at all. If I am running my music through my phone and with the app the features work at first but the the longer I listen the less likely they are bound to work. Meaning the swipe controls for vol, skip song and tap on and off and turning on noise cancellations setting. I lose connection more then I should for no reason.Lets just say I have to go back to my phone app to turn on and off the feature to get them to work correctly way too much. So If you are OK with great sound and noise cancellation with a super long battery life and can put up with the flaws of the special features that you paid for, then buy these. They are very comfortable for me. Sound was too good to send them back though, just disappointed in the special features that sometimes work and sometimes not. (haven't used phone feature at all yet)update 06-16-24: So I now have had these about a year now. My opinion has changed and I thought I would update my review. I am old (62) so I still do a lot of listening through my MP3 players (I have several - not always listening through my phone). My biggest gripe when I got them was the controls and getting the touch features to work properly. Well, it may have been operator error and just getting used to the headphones. I don't seem to be having any trouble with any listening device anymore. When I take my headphones off my head they stop and when I put them back on they start. One thing that I had trouble with early on. I have had a chance to try out the phone features and sound since the purchase and it is pretty darn good. I can not compare to other competitors though, And I don't use that a lot.So sound is great, comfort is great, battery is great and features are now upgraded to great as wellI love em.

Tested on multiple devices, all of which are up to date.To future-proof my review (because I won't remember to edit my review once the firmware problems have been addressed), I rated these 4 stars based on the assumption that there will be a future fix to the firmware problems. If taking the firmware into account, I think I'd rate these 2 stars (as of 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphones have quality sound, probably on par with the price point.

I don't think I'm getting 60 hours (volume kept at around 20-40%), but they're still awesome.Cons:These are nowhere near as comfortable as my Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. They put more pressure on my ears/temples, and the headband is way firmer. My head is aching after about 30 minutes of use.There are significant firmware issues (my firmware is up to date, as of 8/31/22):When using the auto power off mode, they turn on (and sync to your phone) any time they’re moved. This will of course silence your phone’s alerts, as they’re playing over the headphones that you didn’t mean to turn on.When using the on-head detection, they keep turning on and off while they're sitting around my neck.Whenever I answer my phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) and change the output to these headphones it just hangs up the phone. Haven't tried answering using the headphone's touch controls, it's possible that would work.While the transparency mode is a nice feature, it's almost laughable compared to my AirPod Pro's and Sony WF-1000XM4's. It sounds just barely better than wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These can connect to 2 devices at a time, but when switching between paired (and connected) devices (for example: listening to audio on my tablet, when I get a text alert on my phone, which interrupts tablet audio for a second, before switching back to tablet again), and whenever I answer my phone, as mentioned above, audio quits playing over my headphones. My phone says it's still connected, but it doesn't show up as an output in any apps. I have to reconnect it to my phone to get it working again.Whenever I pair them with a new device, it disconnects from existing connected devices. I have to reconnect afterward.As much as I want to like these headphones, until Sennheiser fixes these software issues, it's just not worth the hassle.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AENHFSUN5AOQRWBL5HVKOFBRSN4A,True,56,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R9UOJPHMC1N5R,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones with a few nitpicks,Stan Jarensky,5,"I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2022",AFWSMMKN2GVUKOJA4BDMDRSG7JZQ,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

RJB49JIZ1OE9H,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but not great due to finicky features.",Ryan M Robinson,4,"The sound, noise cancellation, durability, and battery life were the reasons I bought these headphones, and they've delivered in those areas. Sadly, I'm knocking a star off the overall rating because of their ""quality"" of life features and short range.The headphones are meant to sense when they're on your head or not. Sadly, these think they're on my head when they're not, and not on my head when they are, with annoying frequency.Occasionally the ""buttons"" stop working. I use quotes because the actual button works fine, but the tap controls seem to stop working randomly. They'll do the little noise in my ear that indicates the headphones have registered me tapping, but have no actual effect.Further, I live in a house of about 950 sq. ft., yet if I leave the 8x8 room that is my office there's a good chance the sound will start cutting in and out due to the poor range of these headphones. I had a pair of $60 headphones before these, and the range was twice as good on those. This results in sound skipping in and out if I'm more than 6 feet away from my computer, or about 8 feet with no walls in between. It would be nice to be able to fold laundry in the next room over while listening to these, but I cannot.Overall, great sound quality, durability, noise cancelling (very important as I'm work from home with a toddler and an infant in the house), and battery life (I use them 8-10hrs per day and charge once per week), but poor quality of life. For the price, I expected headphones that work correctly.","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AESDI6RME6JBOBVQLOLCSJKOA7GQ,True,20,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R3QDH5SFCC0EE9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 vs Sony WH-1000XM5,Matthew,5,"I've been a Sennheiser fan for a while now and wanted to give these a shot vs the fan favored Sony WH-1000XM5s. Used the Momentum 4s for around a week and was incredibly impressed with the battery life, ease of use, and the sound quality. If you have some audiophile grade equipment with a separate DAC/Amp combo this does not sound as good. That being said, this is miles above alternatives in it's price range.After adjusting to the sound of the Sennheisers for a few days, I immediately had a negative reaction when trying out the Sonys. To my ears they had a noticably dryer sound profile where the highs and mids sounded muffled and flat in comparison (Note: not accuracy flat, just plain dull sounding). The bass is pretty equivalent, at least in EDM/metal/hip hop genres. I listened for a few hours in the Sonys and just couldn't find any songs I thought sounded measurably better than the Sennheisers. Even listening to the same song on the tablet and phone with both headphones back to back, everything was brighter, clearer, and warmer in the Sennheisers and have a noticably better build quality. My first initial reaction to Sennheiser build quality was negative because they felt much lighter than I was expecting having used more serious headphones. The Sonys felt even lighter and more plastic-y/cheaper in comparison.The noise cancelling was noticably better in the Sonys than the Sennheisers, which may or may not be a deal breaker for some. I would imagine the Sonys would perform better on an airplane, but for home/office use I was perfectly happy with both.TLDR: The Sennheisers are the no brainer choice for me.**Momentum 4 quirks/nit picking:- My head gets hot in any headphones with leather ear cups, I could not find alternative/cooler padding which is worth the sound/seal trade off.- The sensors to know if it's on your head are pretty sensitive. It's good when you lift off an ear to hear someone else in the room, they pause. It's bad when you take them off, they 'sleep' on the desk, anything brushes/touches the headphones. It will automatically switch your audio source from your phone back to the headphones. Depending on how often you listen to audio on your phones speaker or are around where these will be when you are not using them, it's easier to turn them off when not in use to avoid having to change your media output on your phone back to the speaker. Samsung phones have a quick media output switch in the drop down quick menu, but not all phones make it this easy.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AGJ3EARFU6PJA75WKR76Z7WUOLNA,True,27,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3S9UDPCJTRMN0,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars M4’s vs XM5’s, if you’re after sound quality this is it.",Seth Montgomery,5,"Sound Quality:So first of all, I have been a big fan of Sony’s wireless lineup and decided to take a departure with these. After these arrived, I did a direct comparison on these vs Sony’s XM5’s, with EQ to my liking and without (across several genres.) The M4’s even without any EQ adjustments beat my XM5’s with them. Man, these things sound great. Clear, precise, open sound. The treble is truly so much more detailed than on the XM5’s, and the midrange and bass feel balanced in more naturally. When I switched back to XM5’s to compare, I was actually shocked at just how much I felt like I was missing in comparison.Comfort:The XM5’s spoil you a bit with their insane plush earcups and super light weight, but I was expecting a bigger difference between those and the M4’s. For me, these are perfectly comfortable. XM5’s definitely win here, but the SQ on the M4’s more than makes up for that.Noise Cancelling:I’m not the person to give the best feedback on this, it’s the last thing I care about. However, If noise cancelling happens to be your main consideration, it’s XM5 here.Setup/connectivity:I was prepared for problems and inconveniences based on reviews and got none. Smooth experience for me so far.In summary, GREAT sound, and if that’s your biggest consideration, I don’t know if you’ll find better elsewhere in Bluetooth headphones anywhere close to this price point.

RQ0W5FUGCFR5X,B0B6GHW1SX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, bad UX Design.",Cacho K,2,"The PXC-550 headphones were my go-to for the past three years, striking the perfect balance between quality sound and comfort, with just a couple of drawbacks: a lack of USB-C support and less-than-ideal battery life. Eager for an upgrade, I transitioned to their successor MOMENTUM, hoping for improvements. On paper, the new model seemed to promise just that—a better, more refined listening experience. However, while the upgrade delivered in some areas, it faltered in others, revealing design flaws that the PXC-550 had already mastered.On the plus side, the sound quality is exceptional, with noise cancellation that effectively silences the outside world, and a battery life that feels almost endless. These improvements alone make the headphones a significant leap forward.But not all changes are for the better. The new design is bulkier. More frustratingly, the intuitive fold-to-turn-off (and on) feature of the PXC-550 has been omitted. The satisfying click of the folding switch, which once brought a sudden moment of reassurance—a Deus ex Machina moment between you and this piece of machinery—is gone. Now, turning off the headphones requires holding down a button for an awkwardly long pause, a process that can accidentally trigger pairing mode instead of powering down. This seemingly small change significantly impacts the user experience, transforming seamless transitions into moments of annoyance.Imagine this: You're about to start your car journey, only to discover your headphones have remained on, constantly attempting to connect to your phone, disrupting the peace of your drive. Or picture yourself at your desk, a sudden visitor arrives, and you're caught in an awkward dance of trying to turn off your headphones, a delay that interrupts the flow of life.This shift from the elegantly simple act of folding your headphones to turn them off and on to a cumbersome, button-dependent process adds up, not just in seconds wasted but in the sheer inconvenience it represents, especially when you know how effortless it once was. The PXC-550 made life smoother, akin to having a trusted steed by your side in the relentless battle of daily existence—a companion so reliable, its absence is profoundly felt.In light of these experiences, one can't help but yearn for a simple solution: a PXC-550 reimagined with USB-C. Such a proposition seems a minor ask for the return of what was lost—the instant gratification and reassurance of effortlessly powering down by folding, a feature that made the PXC-550 an indispensable part of life's arsenal.One could say that the new headphones, while technologically superior, miss the mark on understanding the rhythm of life. The joy of technology is not just in its capability but in its ability to blend seamlessly into our lives, enhancing without complicating. The previous model understood this, becoming more than just a tool for listening—it was a companion in the epic battle of everyday life.As it stands, despite its technological strides, the newer model leaves something to be desired for those of us who cherish both the journey and the simplicity of interaction with our gadgets. In essence, the quest for improvement should not forsake the intuitive pleasures of the past.Btw 80 seconds a day with this button nonsense, equals to 8 hours a years of frustration.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AF3JMHEBBABMCAMCXQHQBEXC2ONQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I know it's slightly unfair to compare the Momentum 4 to this particularly Sony headphone but I didn't expect the Sony's to compare in terms of sound quality (they don't come close) or noise cancelling (the Sony's were pretty similar honestly... very good on both). But I did expect quality design and construction since it's virtually identical to higher priced Sony's. Bottom line: Sennheiser has quality construction and Sony doesn't. As soon as you pick up a pair of the Sony's, it's easy to tell that they are somewhat fragile. I even had a pretty good notion of where they would break... and I was right. The Sennheiser's are much more robust, and really feel like they can handle some tough use.I also found the app to be very intuitive and easy to use, unlike a few other reviewers... definitely easier than the Sony app.My only slight complaint is the touch sensitive control feature.

R2LOLFHZ6R8BHD,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great and usage is very streamlined,Henry,5,"I like how most Sennheiser headphones sound, and these are no exception. The app also lets you further tune the sound to your liking if you feel the need to, and if you don't want to play around with the EQ options, you can just use the ""sound personalization"" feature which is basically a quiz that will help create an optimal sound setting for you. The usage experience with these is the most streamlined I have had with any headphones so far. I use my headphones primarily with my PC, and with older headphones switching the connection from my PC to my phone was a pain, and because of that I rarely did it. With these, you have multi-point connection, which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once, and the headphones will switch between them based on which one is playing audio. That, combined with the auto on and off feature, means I can just pick these up off my desk and put them on, then use my PC and/or phone as needed without thinking about it, and then just plop them back on my desk when I'm done and they will shut down automatically. There are however a couple of things I can think of to complain about. Number one is I wish Sennheiser made a dedicated Windows app to change settings directly from a PC, but the multi-point connection means this isn't really a big deal anymore because they are always connected to my phone anyway if I want to change settings. Number 2, I would like to have some kind of audio queue when I reach the midpoint between transparency mode and ANC. As is, when you are using the touch controls to scroll between full ANC and full transparency mode, you get an audio queue when you reach either of those settings, but the midpoint where you have neither ANC nor transparency mode active isn't obvious unless you pull out the app and check where it is set. A small issue but it would further improve ease of use with these. Overall, I'm super happy with them.

Since I usually use Sennheiser headphones, that and the transparency mode swayed me to get this over Bose QC45 and Sony 1000XM4.I'm not sure I made the right choice. Almost none of the features work properly.Mine keeps turning off or disconnecting. Listen to 1-3 songs and it'll cut off in the middle of a song. Several times an hour sometimes. Tried it where I don't really have much interference, and same exact thing. Tried wearing it one night to listen to music while sleeping, and it just turned off randomly after about 20 minutes of playing. So it paused my music.Take them off and sometimes they'll still keep playing music. Sometimes, I bump into it laying flat on my desk and it'll start playing music. Tap the right side it clear a click, and music will keep playing. Swipe 2-3 times to change songs and it might do it on the first try or never. Neither my car nor my bluetooth speakers have this type of issues. Then sometimes, you adjust them because they feel like they're falling a bit, and you'll trigger the pause.The battery life is pretty good, thankfully. Because it'll stay on sometimes for hours and not turn off. This is with the 15 minutes auto shut down. So you might come back the next morning and it dropped from 90% to 70% because it never turned off.The transparency mode is... just ok. It makes the AC in my office much louder than when I have my headphones off. Like twice as loud. Unless I turn on max wind ANC. But then sound always sound muffled. But even at max transparency and low music volume, I cannot comprehend anyone talking. It sounds like it amplifies constant noise much more than occasional noise.If I wear them while washing dishes, the ANC works really well here too. So it seems to work best with constant noise.The Android App is also extremely slow. You open it, and it has to connect. After it connects, it's unresponsive for another 5 seconds or so. So it takes 10-15 seconds to open settings.I was expecting a quick button to toggle between listening to music, and transparency mode. Right now, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to adjust. Imagine telling someone to wait 20 seconds while you enable the feature, instead of spending 0.5 second removing them.Additional notes: I didn't buy them for the ANC. I care more about low leakage so I'm not disturbing other people in the office. It's also why I wanted transparency mode, so I can still hear other people if they want something.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2022",AGJDE3TR26ZJIIR5CINP4GMUWLCA,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2EMRYUEWAB9JV,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Too Much Low Bass; Not Ideal for Aircraft Travel,JCW2,4,"Really good sound, clean and clear with great frequency response. The one sad detail is WAY too much low bass. This is not to say it's bad bass, and it reaches much lower frequencies than most phones. It's tight and musical, but it's enough at the bottom end to cause audible distortion in higher frequencies during dense orchestral passages. (This is one reason speaker manufacturers use separate drivers for bass and treble.) I agree with the excellent review by M&N (under ""Other Countries"") except that only a 1 dB reduction in bass is not enough. These phones start to sound reasonably realistic on music with a lot of low bass after a 6 dB bass reduction (the max provided by the equalizer in the app), but I would prefer even more, preferably affecting only the very low end.Another problem potential buyers should consider is that there seems to be ZERO support from the manufacturer for this product. (Part of the problem could be that Sennheiser's consumer products division has been sold to a new company calling itself ""Sennheiser Hearing,"" so they might get this worked out in time.) So it's currently impossible to get operation and usage questions answered. Right now it appears that the equalizer settings are not applied when listening to a wired audio source. Since this is a major application of noise-cancelling phones -- think airplane travel, where Bluetooth is not allowed -- it constitutes a major drawback.Another issue for travel is the heavy, bulky case that comes with these phones. The phones themselves are reasonably compact, weighing about 10.3 oz, but the case is thicker and way stiffer than necessary to protect them and weighs a hefty 13.7 oz, more than doubling the total.Update 03/09/23: Access to technical support is improving lately, at least by telephone. When I finally got hold of them, I was told that, indeed, it is normal function that the phones do NOT apply any user equalization settings when used with an analog (phone-cable) input.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2023",AEPJX4BN6PLNQ7ZQPJYNDJBSBXCA,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R10V36NAFXZEZA,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Wanted to Rate This Five Stars,Polarbear,4,"I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use. Sennheiser please make this right for me.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2022",AERFLNH4Q3EDNJQT4AYNMOJ7XK6A,True,58,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

So i am not pro in this, but i liked this ones so much, i decided to write a review.I want to start with cons, for me personally, it’s how they falling off when i am working out. Not to confuse you, they are comfortable and “steady” on the head, when you walk, or just laying on the couch. But when im working out it just feels like they are about to fall down my head. I am not sure if this is special problem of this headphones, or just general issue among all over-ear headphones.Except what written above, these headphones are perfect. Especially because of rich/balanced sound, and features in the app. Compared to meze 99 they sound more rich, and better overall, even though meze are wired. And app is on another level, even though i have iphone, its features are surprisingly wide-ranged. The case is alright, I did not use it that often.So i loved it, even though they are not that good for gym (airpods are better), sound made me keep them","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AGWBXITFMXYZD4FUV5P3LDV26ISA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I have noise cancelling buds which I love but in-ear for a long flight gets tiring. I've long been a fan of Sennheiser. These do not disappoint. They are not perfect at noise canceling, but they do remove background to the point I can enjoy music or movie while ""escaping from the plane"", yet not be oblivious to the flight attendant offering me dinner. They sound good - not the loudest but that's probably good for long listening. And I can use bluetooth with my Droid, or plug-in to the plane. But a key criterion was battery life. I literally flew around the world on a single charge. The tiniest quibble is the touch controls, which might do something I don't understand and have trouble undoing now and then.

R2BABA4LYTEDVO,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, iffy connectivity",anonamazon,5,"These headphones are among the best I've ever heard; their sound quality is unmatched in the area. Sennheiser is well known for this, and definitely live up to expectations here. You can tune them to your liking with an optional bass boost toggle in the app that makes music very punchy, which in my opinion adds a lot to these headphones.While the experience on mobile has been seamless with no issues, the same cannot be said for desktop. Periodically on desktop there is connection dropout with bursts of static upon reconnection.Notwithstanding the connection, this pair of headphones are my first with ANC. I think it works well enough, although from what I've seen it's hardly comparable to Sony's XM5s.The touch controls are sensitive, as many others have said. However, I don't find it to be much of an issue on a day-to-day basis. While having buttons would be nice, I find the touch controls to be rather intuitive and have come to like them.Overall, with the great sound and controls, I can easily say it's worth the price and more than makes up for the slight issues that you may come across when using them. I am more leaning towards 4 stars for this review, but in my personal opinion it gets a 5.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AHWHDQ2NV7UMZ6CUMUT7GXH2FKTA,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

These might be the most perfect headphones I ever used and I am absolutely an authority when it comes to headphones, as I use them 5 hours a day and have bought every model on the market for 20+ years.The sound is so very clear and I hear frequencies I never heard before in all my old music. Blows away the HD600s. Incredible. Flawless. No other manufacturer can match this, definitely not Sony or even Bose. The closest are the Apple studio headphones but still not really by a very significant margin. Apple did make some very clever in ear wired headphones in 2010 that are fairly close but no longer manufacture those. Forget airpod prosThe ANC is the best I ever heard as well, too good actually I almost got hit by a car. It’s kind of unbelievableNo issues with the bluetooth and it connects to two devices at once without any issues, switching automatically as the sources produce sound. Flawless operation and the app is simple and well thought outThe build quality is perfect. Design is very stylish and classy. Touch sensor almost never goes off by accident. Premium materials, super light, very comfortable I even fell asleep wearing themThe battery (!!!!) lasts 60 hours at full volume and these things can be loud. 60 hours! and they charge in about 1 and a half.So, perfection. PERFECTION. These are the best I ever had. In fact these might be the best headphones in the history of the EarthUpdate: Ok they aren’t perfect. What appears to be a firmware bug disables the touch controls randomly and you need to restart the headphones to get them back. Well, whatever. Still 9.999/10Update 2: So the firmware has two major issues.1) You are forced to disable the head sensor because if you take off and then put back the headphones too quickly it disables the touch controls bc of a bug. Unfortunately this means they won’t auto off and your 60 hour battery runs down continuously even without use and might as well be a 10 hours. Facepalm.2) The ANC setting resets every time you recharge and can only be reset from the app. This is deliberate IMO so they force you to keep opening the app bc it’s spyware","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AGNTDROPGCQOTPJUEENZL7KDDR2Q,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RKREDCIKWK311,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally...one of the best out there!,James Irmiger,4,"I've been holding off on this review until I lived with these for a while. I got them when they launched and put them head to head against the Bowers & Wilkins, Sony XM4's and 5's, Master & Dynamic, and Dali...all ANC, Bluetooth, etc, etc.. I'll summarize as best I can.In -kinda- the same price range, they all sound good. The Sony's are muddy, the Bowers a little over equalized, the M&D are clear as a bell, but lack bass, and the Dali's are smooth as butter, but have poor construction (broke 2). Finally, the Momentum 4's are a touch bass heavy, but with a little equalization, that goes away and they turn nicely neutral.My biggest gripe was usability, not sound. The 4's have switched to a massive touch surface on the right cup. Normally, I don't mind newer tech, but OMG! Anything getting near them makes a selection. Hair, collars, pillows, you name it. After 7 months, they finally fixed it with firmware 2.13.18. You can now disable the touch controls, but you still can't adjust the sensitivity, or the stock control gestures. Ah well, can't be perfect, but they did also add a new automatic sound tuning feature that really works.I like the sound profile a lot, they're built well for plastic, they have a nice case, ANC is 80% of the big boys, but lacks their cabin pressure, mics are awesome for calls, and a big as heck battery to boot.

R12D0ZLRZ4AQC7,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars So Glad I Ignored the Bad Reviews!!!,HSPS2,5,"I was concerned about the number of medium/bad reviews but went ahead and ordered based on the many excellent reviews and Sennheiser's stellar reputation. After lots of reading, I came to believe that many of the bad reviews resulted from user error and perhaps compatibility/connectivity issues related to the often quirky Apple (iPhone/iPad/iHome) interface. After about one month of using the M4 headphones, I couldn't be happier. Yes, there is a learning curve with the touch controls and Sennheiser's app, especially for us seniors, but with practice, I'm now very comfortable and proficient. FYI, I use the M4's almost exclusively with my late model MOTO phone via bluetooth (android 12). Also, I have other high-end headphones for comparison. Here's what I really like about the M4's:The headphones updated flawlessly (about 25 minutes) right out of the box.The app installed and runs without a hitch - almost zero lag with all adjustments.The M4's connect immediately with my phone and the app, and stay connected.I've never experienced the mysterious ""turning on while in the case"" or when not wearing the headphones.Great Sennheiser sound for my music (Amazon Music). The rich, full sound with pleasant base is enhanced even further when I turn on Dolby Atmos Smart Audio in my phone's settings. (I thought the Sennheiser app might override this feature but it doesn't. I love the sound.)Call sound is very clear. Most people I speak with say they wouldn't know I'm using the headphones.Noise cancelling/transparency has a wide range of adjustment and I can easily shut out the noisy world - it's right up there with the biggest names in noise cancelling.Battery life is unbelievable. OMG, it never seems to go down!The oval, fairly large ear cups cover my large ears without problem.The understated look of the M4's is appreciated. I don't need to be a walking bill-board or get any attention in public.The carrying case is one of the best I've seen - compact, nice padding, stiff. Great protection!The headphones are comfortable to wear for a few hours. There is a little more clamping force than some others, but they stay put.Overall, a great purchase. Highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2023",AEGBJZRGWXCSS5SKS3DHHWHSSDZA,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3RQ6GTUWPK41X,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 Unboxing and review,Mrs. Wendy L. Stefan,5,"The media could not be loaded. From the moment I pulled these from the box I knew I was in for a treat. They have a solid build quality and are lightweight without feeling cheap. The earmuffs are soft and comfortable even wearing glasses.Where these truly shine is sound quality. Right out of the box they sound warm and detailed. With minor adjustments to the EQ through the Sennheiser app they are truly delightful! I played some test tracks and warmed them up with some brown noise for an hour or so, however whether that is necessary or not is debatable.I have not tried calls with them yet but the noise cancelling is quite good. The settings in the app allow you to customize the ANC and unless it is set to automatically adjust, you can change the amount of ANC using touch on the right speaker.Touch controls were easy to use and function as expected. The headphones pause playback if you take the right cup off your ear which could be frustrating for some, but If you want to hear someone, slide the left side off your ear and the media will not pause.Definitely a high quality set of headphones built to last from a brand known for quality. So far I have not experienced any of the app issues others have mentioned. Firmware update went smoothly and took significantly less than the 22min it had initially told me it would take.I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone looking for a quality, well balanced and detailed sounding set of headphones. Does not get super loud would be my only complaint if I had one.

R36ZIV2E3IZWRL,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite noise cancelling headphone,WT,5,"I recently added the Momentum 4 to my collection of noise cancelling headphones. The others I currently own are the Sennheiser PXC550, Technics EAH-F70N, Sony WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5. I don't have any Bose headphones because I don't care for their sound signature. For noise cancellation, the Sony XM5 are the best, but only by a small margin over the XM4. However, the XM5's adaptive noise cancellation cannot be turned off and for some, this is a big negative. There are people who want maximum noise cancellation all the time. Not just when they are in very noisy conditions. The Momentum 4 also uses adaptive noise cancellation but unlike the XM5, it can be turned off.For maximum noise cancellation, I prefer the XM5. Especially for long flights. I also carry the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for when I get tired of wearing headphones. In almost all other situations, I prefer the Momentum 4 and Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds for their ""nearly as good"" noise cancellation and superior comfort and sound. I prefer the Sennheiser sound because I find the Sony to be too bright for long listening sessions. They can be fatiguing for me. The Sennheiser sounds more natural, and the sub-bass is really good for a headphone. I also find the Momentum 4 to be more comfortable than the XM5 especially if I wear them for more than an hour or so.Random thoughts:The XM5 is louder than the Momentum 4.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are not as compact as the XM4 and PXC550 respectively.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are the same shape, but the Momentum 4 case is slightly smaller.The Momentum 4 has thicker earpads and are more comfortable than the XM5.The Momentum 4 sub-bass will rattle your brain more than the XM5.The Momentum 4 has an automatic switch-on/off feature that can be somewhat annoying at times. It can also be switched on and off manually.The Momentum 4 battery life is super long.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2022",AHZKXYBFWRA53YQ6TPGOZN3DQQEA,True,5,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

But for $350+ headphones, I expected more from the audio quality.Am I accustomed to a standalone amp and wired closed-back headphones? Yes. Do I use wireless headphones otherwise? All the time (mostly buds). Do these senheisers blow me away? No.The details in the audio is very solid, but where it lacks is sheer power. Do I intend to blast my ears at full volume? Absolutely not, but with ALL my other wireless headphones, I'm usually floating around half volume, while with these, I'm always a click or two away from full volume, which is crazy... I'm only 35 and have near perfect hearing, so something with these just feels off, like something an update could rectify to unlock a bit more volume capacity. I've heard others trying 3rd party apps to increase volume, which does work, but I find that an annoying workaround.The noise canceling is almost non existent, which I read prior to buying but I was still surprised at their lack of noise canceling ability. Ambient noise is audible, and this is why the volume is an issue, it's a vicious cycle.The touch controls work well but can be a little finicky, especially the autopause feature which stops music upon removing the headphones from your head.Overall, good headphones, but not amazing for the price and those who like to hear their music in louder environments.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AEPQE6ZBDHU2PHPUNTN5CDBSPFNA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
