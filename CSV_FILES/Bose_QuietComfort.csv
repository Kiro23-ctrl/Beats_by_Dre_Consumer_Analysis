RR2BBF10DJ1YI,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best noise cancelling headphones money can buy.,Bryan,5,"These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AEU5UJKGXQ6DSRMACQYMYZ5IG26A,True,181,Color: Black
R3ODEWU6VR0GD7,B0CCZ1L489,"5.0 out of 5 stars Bose's best offering to date if you value sound quality, comfort, and ANC",Oliver,5,"I own the Bose QC45 and have recently tried comparable headphones in this class including the B&W PX7 S2 and Sennheiser Momentum 4. The Bose QC Ultra are probably the best among this group when it comes to my top three priorities - sound quality, comfort, and ANC. Here are my relative rankings in these categories:SOUND QUALITYI was a bit skeptical at first that Bose's new Immersion Mode would amount to a mere marketing gimmick, but it's really unlike anything that I've ever heard. It's hard to describe (you have to listen for yourself!). Immersion Mode somehow gives the sense that the audio source is in front of you (almost like speakers), which ultimately creates a more expansive, 3D-ish effect that makes the music ""come alive."" I now listen exclusively in Immersion Mode and don't know that I can go back to the more traditional, ""closed-off"" sound of other headphones. The QC Ultra is a definite step-up from the QC45.I was also impressed with the B&W PX7 S2's balanced and clean sound signature; however, I had to return my pair because the left ear cup suddenly and inexplicably went dead after only a week of gentle use. I contemplated repurchasing because of how good they sound but don't want to take the chance on receiving another dud.While the M4 has a loyal following, I was personally disappointed by the Sennheiser sound signature. The M4 was too bass-heavy for my taste; moreover, the clarity/separation for vocals and instruments was muddy and often overpowered by the bass.Rankings: QC Ultra >= PX7 S2 > QC45 > M4COMFORTBoth the QC45 and QC Ultra live up to the ""comfort"" in their names. Their light weight and plush padding are second to none, with perhaps a slight edge to the QC45. The PX7 S2 is also quite pleasant to wear but a little heavier compared to Bose. I was not a fan of the M4, which felt a bit cheap to me; the material used for the ear pads was not breathable (think hot ears), and the clamping force was tighter than Bose and B&W.Rankings: QC45 >= QC Ultra > PX7 S2 > M4ANCBose has earned a reputation as the ""King of ANC"", a title that is well-deserved IMO. Both the QC45 and QC Ultra are noticeably more effective at drowning out ambient noise than the PX7 S2 and M4.Rankings: QC Ultra = QC45 > PX7 S2 = M4Hope that my observations help you if you're trying to decide between these headphone options. I plan to keep the QC Ultra as Bose has made substantial improvements to the QC45, namely the Immersion Mode, that justify the price differential for me. I do wish that the battery life were longer, but its other distinguishing features make up for it. Overall, I'd give the QC Ultra 4.5 (rounding up to 5) stars!","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AH7Z7HSRSEDGQAGZRQG6E2CRVRRQ,True,47,Color: White Smoke

R24X8QCZ5R5EJA,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones in the market!,Amir Hasani,5,"Initial Impressions:From the moment I unboxed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, I was struck by their sleek, sophisticated design. The headphones are incredibly light, and the plush ear cushions felt luxurious the moment I put them on. Powering them up for the first time, I was greeted by a user-friendly voice prompt that guided me through the Bluetooth connection process, which was quick and seamless.Build Quality & Design:The build quality of these headphones is exactly what you would expect from Bose—robust yet refined. They sport a minimalistic style, with a focus on comfort and durability. The materials used are top-notch, ensuring that the headphones not only last but also retain their aesthetic appeal over time. The ear cups rotate and fold neatly, making them perfect for travel and storage.Sound Quality:Bose has always been a pioneer in sound technology, and these headphones are no exception. The sound clarity is exceptional, with rich bass, crisp highs, and detailed mids. Whether I'm listening to classical music, hard rock, or cinematic scores, every genre is rendered with precision and depth. The active noise cancelling function is superb, effectively blocking out external noises and creating an immersive listening environment.Wireless Connectivity:The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, with a strong and stable connection. I can wander around my house with the headphones on without any drop in audio quality or interruptions. Additionally, the multi-connect feature allows the headphones to be connected to two devices simultaneously, which is a great convenience.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive. On a single charge, I can get up to 20 hours of playtime with noise cancelling on, which is more than enough for a day's use or a long flight. The quick charge feature is also a lifesaver, providing hours of playtime with just a few minutes of charging.Additional Features:One standout feature is the adjustable noise cancelling, which allows you to modify the level of noise cancellation depending on your environment. The touch-sensitive controls on the ear cups are intuitive, providing easy access to volume, track control, and voice assistants.Final Thoughts:The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are a testament to what high-quality headphones can offer. They provide a perfect blend of style, comfort, and superior sound quality, with noise cancelling that truly stands out in busy environments. Whether for travel, work, or just enjoying your favorite tunes at home, these headphones are an excellent investment. They earn a well-deserved five stars for elevating my audio experience beyond expectations.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AFWHMQCSZG6TLEWC6FVIHKWOQY4A,True,12,Color: Black
R2YCVGCT28KXGR,B0CCZ1L489,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is flat, but battery life is great.",iWillBreakFree,3,"I have used these headphones almost daily since June 2023 and do not like them. I wish I could return them for something else. I purchased these because I liked their Bose Sport Earbuds, but those were starting to cause earwax to clog up my ear canals. So I decided to buy these to focus on school and work. I wanted to drown out background noise, so I didn't get distracted, which happens easily to me. ""Oh, look, a potato chip!"" - plays with the potato chip. I still use the earbuds when I work out and they function very well for that purpose. Anyways, lets get on with it, here are a few pro's and many con'sPro:1. Battery life is accurate. I normally get about 24 hours of battery life out of them. I'm not timing it, I judge it based on the number of days used which is about 4 days before needing a charge.2. Noise canceling is fantastic. I will sometimes be working in the living room; someone else can be blasting the TV, and it sounds like quiet muddled background noise.Con:1. The expectation of sound quality is terrible, considering the price I paid for them. The sound quality is very flat and muddy, and there is little to no sound separation. I can get similar quality headphones for a quarter of the amount spent on these headphones.2. Comfort is very dependent on your head shape. But with mine, they start to hurt on top of my head where the band is and behind the lower part of my ear. I've adjusted them so they don't squeeze so hard, but they become too loose and easily fall off.3. Auto-Pause is annoying. You have an auto-pause option when you pull them off your right ear. That being said, when I turn my head, they will pause for no reason. It's annoying because there is times it doesn't recognize that it's back on your ears and not play. This means you need to use your phone or press the assigned button each time to start playing. You will need to loosen them a little to stop this, but they can easily fall off. This leaves you to decide if you want them to fall off easily or for it to auto-pause frequently almost every time you turn your head. So, if you plan on using these to work out with, it can be distracting and ruin your flow.4. Bose App. First, the app could be more worthwhile. It allows you to assign the shortcut button on your headphones to very basic features like Hearing Battery Level, Change Immersive Audio, Voice Assistant, and Spotify. A long hold on this button will change your noise-cancelling option. But the app is almost never updated unless it's for some advertisement and never adds any features to your headphones.5. Bose App - EQ. It doesn't You can use this to ""adjust"" the eq, but it only gives you bass/mid/treble and really doesn't do anything to help with the sound quality. If you listen to multiple genres of music like I do, you want the option to have some preset eq settings, but without a proper adjustment of the EQ, it really doesn't matter.6. Bose App/Immersive Audio. This is just marketing crap. If you have it on, when you turn your head to any side, the sound will shift over to the opposite side. That's all. It ruins the sound more when it's on, so I always have it off.7. Wearing the headphones. Not really that bad of a feature. You need to place them on correctly. They have R/L inside each cup and will only work on those sides. So, if you are like me and place them flat on your desk, there is a learning curve to make sure you place them correctly on your head.Conclusion:Save your money. I would recommend other headphones, but I am not made of money and don't have a ton of different headphones to suggest. Please take another look at other options in this price range. Bose, if you read this, can we talk about returning them so I can get my money back, I still have the original case that these came with.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AFO2DKPA3M27JFTIWXGRSBDVGFZQ,True,0,Color: Black
RMARAQXAFN8Z9,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!,SawyerMan,5,"To start out, I must say I am very fussy about audio. I have a small recording studio, which I spend at least eight hours a day in. I have three different sets of headphones, which all have a personality of their own when it comes to sound and mixing, I have a couple of Bose speakers which are excellent and have always been impressed with their products. I did not buy these with the intent of mixing, just for listening out of the studio. Most headphones don’t reflect what a good pair of studio monitors produce. These headphones , do an excellent job of reproducing accurate recordings, good and bad. The features of these headphones was really more than I needed, but I was presently surprised how good they sounded. As I have found over the years with Bose, there was always a little problem in the mids, but the clarity was so clear it was a no-brainer. Ever since I’ve started using these I can’t get them off my ears. I started using them in place of my flat response headphones because they give me a good reflection of my monitors. they are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the features are top-notch in the noise cancellation is about as good as it gets in a set of headphones. The volume control can be a little bit hard to get used to, but the more I use them the easier it gets, as usual. The one thing I don’t really care for and it’s being kind of picky is, I normally will use these with a wired connection in the studio to avoid any latency by using Bluetooth. But you have to have the headphones powered on even when wire direct. My other headphones don’t use any battery power when plugged in direct. Now, if you’re into high-tech, you’re going to love the immersive settings on these cans. I have no idea how they pull this off and it wasn’t the reason that I bought them in the first place, but these things are awesome. I guess there’s no way I can really explain how they work and what it sounds like so I guess you’ll have to buy a pair for yourself. The problem with that is that they are a little pricey as always with Bose, but I think in this case they’re worth it. I was prepared to send these back if they didn’t sound good, simply based on how much they cost , so I was pleasantly surprised and how good they were. If you can get by the price, you will be happy with these headphones. Nothing is perfect, that’s for sure, but in the audio department these things come pretty close….Nice job Bose !","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AH2EV4FBMGFY4OCQTR2KGXU4YC4Q,True,22,Color: Black
RGSDD50WQC9SO,B0CCZ1L489,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancelling, call quality, and sound. Terrible everything else.",User312938,3,"I have owned numerous QC35's, QC45's, and a pair of 700s. I've tried some Sony's but never used them as my daily driver. I wear my headphones nearly all day while I work, go to the gym, take walks, and frequently when falling asleep. These are a a substantial upgrade over previous Bose headphones in the sound department, but a MAJOR downgrade in literally every other way.Pros-Fantastic noise cancelling-Great call quality-Good sound quality-Fold flatCons-Much flimsier (at the hinge) than QC45-Volume adjuster is basically useless for anything other than large changes. Trying to get just the right volume while listening to a podcast? Have damp fingers at the gym? Have long hair? In a quiet room and need fine adjustments? Don't even bother using the headphone volume slider.-Ear cups are slightly smaller and less soft than QC45-Ear cups wear out much faster than QC45-Power button functioning is inconsistent. Sometimes it does nothing, sometimes has a long pause. No correlation to on head detection. It's just such a step back from the QC45-Sometimes reboots randomly-Immersive audio is gimmic, or at the very least isn't compatible with a very active lifestyle and using these headphones in many daily environments-On head detection/auto off works inconsistently when wearing them while head against a pillow-These things just waste your time. Want to turn them off - hold the button and count to 3. So you probably had to think about it for a total of 4 seconds. If you turn them off 5 times in a day, that's 20 seconds a day. If I do that say 6 days a week, I'm spending 2 minutes per week just thinking about turning my headphones off. That's 104 minutes per year I'm literally thinking about turning these stupid things off. Want to check the battery level? You have to wait for them to do the boot cycle, then speak to you, then turn them off by holding the off button for 3 seconds.-Nitpick vs QC45 #1: no quick way to just feel the headphone and know which side is R/L to put them on your head. There's a tiny button you can try to find, but it's not like the On/Off switch you could feel on the QC45-Nitpick vs QC45 #2: The button to turn them off is on the side of the headphone WITHOUT the USB C power jack, so have to move them in your hands, then plug them in.-not water proofI feel like Bose decided they had to follow Sony and Apple in trying to keep up with ""modern features"" and style, but in doing so they really have lost a lot of the great functionality that made the previous models so amazing.The next good over-ear headphones I invest in will probably not be Bose.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AHU45EABLFNNPWPHAHU42RJ67U6Q,True,49,Color: Black
RW608C3GWLZZA,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound quality but some minor build quality issues,Rocky Soamc,4,"I'm fairly picky about my noise canceling headphones. I've owned Sony XM-5, Sony XM-4, Bose Quiet Comfort 700 and these outperform all of those by at least a small but noticable amount. The ANC isn't magic, but it is as effective as anything I've used. On a recent flight I had a screaming infant about 3 rows back and while it couldn't block all of the sound, it barely intruded and wasn't noticable when a song was actively playing. Sound quality is excellent and the immersive audio feature is a welcome addition. My only gripe as far as audio quality is that Bose seems to subscribe to Apple's philosophy about the user experience: they're going to put some effort into creating a nice experience, but you'd better agree at least on the broad strokes of what makes for a nice user experience because they don't give you much wiggle room to customize it. I'd like to be able to tune the sound to my liking a little bit more. Bose keeps the EQ simple--a little too simple for my tastes--with the option only to adjust low mid and high. Compared to what Sony's app offers this feels very restrictive. A few more bands on the EQ would be a welcome addition.My only complaints are minor: After two months of daily use, the stitching on the ear pads has come apart with about 60% of the stitching on each side separated already. At this price point, I'd expect better durability and longevity. Replacement pads range from about $22 to $35, so this isn't a meaningless complaint.The other minor annoyance is I wish these had a little bit more ""clamping power"" in the headband. I understand that you have to strike a balance between squeezing somebody's head like it's in a vice and the headphones staying in place no matter what you're doing with your head, but these err a little too much on the loose side. Clearly these aren't intended to use as your workout headphones, but even just lying down on a flat bench is generally going to make them come off your ears.Everything else seems to function properly and be holding up well and I do not regret the purchase. They're very expensive, but not necessarily a bad value. I had to work pretty hard to justify a $400 set of headphones, but if it's something that you'll use enough and effective noise cancelling is a must have, these might barely edge into the "" justifiable luxury"" column, but will never be anywhere near ""practical"".","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AFH7EWSZGJ5SANZTGPSUR4CWONZQ,True,14,Color: Black

Band made out of aluminum even with hinge so that's solid.Cons:These headphones can tend to become a fingerprint magnet especially on the bose logo, a solution would be to buy a cover or get a vinal sticker to cover them to your liking.And you can't seem to turn off the anc, only way I seemed to was to make a custom profile and turn the anc all the way down. About the app, the immersion mode is a little lack luster to what I was expecting, makes the headphones sound like a speaker system around you in a hollow room? (Would like a way to change that echoing and such)All in all?These are a premium headset and a lot of these issues can be fixed through the apps settings like the wake on lift ect, turning that off will make the pair turn on faster through the power button, I do miss the switch for power, but to give an automatic power on and off so I can be less worried about forgetting to turn them off is such a nice feature vs you forget to turn off the qc 35 off and now they are 25% in the morning, more or less these are for people who want the best of the best from bose, any issues I've seen from the 1 stars seem to be a user error as these cans will sound as good as they can with a capable phone, don't bother pairing these with a old phone that doesn't supoort adpt x or ACC and expect the best sounding experience.","Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2024",AGF4LKTHI73ZXZ32JMENWS75CLQA,True,20,Color: Sandstone

I play “Thunderstorms by Sleep Jar through my Alexa app and I don’t remember when I feel asleep so quickly.Now the bad part of this compliment sandwich:It could be just me, but after a couple hours, my ears began to hurt. I’m talking about the outside part of the ear. Again, it could be just me. But I thought I should mention it if your motivation for buying these is to use them for extended periods of time.Now the final layer of this sandwich:Sound reproduction on these headsets is very good.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AHIDRACB7GZ6XZENHLULXJ3J67EA,True,0,Color: Black

I just love music and work a desk job, so these bad boys stay on ALL DAY ERRRDAY. The immersive audio options are fantastic. The sound is immaculate and there's an EQ that does more than most people would ever need it to. My ONLY small gripe would be that they changed the volume to a touch that I accidentally mess with when I'm feeling for the other button. There's probably a way to change it in the app, but it's not been a big enough problem for me to look into. The COMFORT is second to none. Like I said, these puppies stay on my head ALL DAY and do not hurt my ears or squeeze my head or fall off... they are perfect. The hearthrough option is great for when I need to listen out for coworkers or whatever. When I'm focused in on my screens, I switch to immersive and the world outside of my monitors and my ears fades away into obscurity like it never existed at all.

The sound quality is fair enough and I can enjoy listening not only instrumental music but also classic rock.I didn't like the volume control. It's not so easy or the tactile feedback is not there.

R30RY1LCLTMU71,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Not ready for prime time!,Matt,4,"EDIT (1/8/2024): I discovered a workaround that is partially effective. In the Bose Music app, on the Modes tab, hit the + button to add a new mode. On this tab, you can access a Noise Cancellation level slider with 10 levels. Putting the slider about half way allows enough ambient sound to come through that you can hear yourself speak while still reducing distractions around you. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Number one thing you need to know: If you're using these for meetings or phone calls, wait. Right now, there is a bug where you cannot hear yourself speak (i.e. self voice / side tone doesn't work). It's as if you're conducting a meeting with ear plugs in. This is Bose firmware 1.5.4 (for those of you reading this in the future).I've tried this on two different headsets, one from Amazon, one from Walmart, different manufacturing dates. It flat out doesn't work - there is no difference between high self voice and off. I've also updated the Bose Music app - doesn't help. The good news is that this is probably a software bug as aware mode seems to work (can hear myself speak but also hear everything else in the room as well).Bottom line - I think this headset is nice, but I'm not sure about it being worth $420, and definitely not worth that amount when I have to switch to my older QC35s to conduct Teams meetings so I can hear myself speak.Also not a fan of the solid state volume slider. I much prefer the buttons on the QC35 series.Edit: On the Pro side: one not advertised feature is bluetooth range. This headset supports bluetooth 5.3 which is a significant upgrade from 4.x that the QC 35ii supports. With this headset, I can leave my phone in one corner of the house and walk all the way over to the other corner with no loss of signal. It's more than double the range of the older bluetooth protocols. The headset is backwards compatible with bluetooth 4 devices, but to get this benefit, make sure your phone / laptop / whatever supports bluetooth 5.On the negative side, another feature that annoys me on this set of headphones is the on-head detection. The way it's supposed to work is that when you take off your headphones, they automatically pause whatever is playing and go into a low power state. In theory...In practice, this is somewhat annoying for two reasons:1. It's not bullet proof. Maybe 1 out of 20 times I take off the headphones, it doesn't detect it and the music keeps playing. The benign case is when music is playing and you notice it and fix it. The treacherous case is when you've already paused the music, take off the headset, and then it doesn't go low power mode. Next time you wear them the battery will be dead. 2. If you take off the headphones, they don't disconnect from Bluetooth right away. It takes some time before it disconnects. So you end up having to manually disconnect anyway to use your phone / laptop speakers instead of the headset, and at that point you wonder why these don't simply have a slider on / off switch like the older models.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2023",AHCZVQCWBAMXLKKZQXHPNKGS4YNA,True,36,Color: Black

I use these for online desktop gaming, fully charged and purposely connected. I a 45 minute match it will randomly diviner twice on average. Now that is annoying enough, but it gets a little worse. The microphone is atrocious. I went and spent another 100 bucks on getting a really good ml standing microphone for my pc. Now into why I traded these so highly. The sound quality is good enough that your songs sound different. They sound so much better. Not to say audiophile grade, but certainly a cut above my astro a40s from before. (tho it's 3 generations old by now) and instead of the ASTRO a50s (Bluetooth variant as opposed to the corded I use to run) I chose these. They're great. Multiple profiles to control the sound canceling (which is blissful quiet on my bus rides) and great app support that can add custom profiles that adjust anc and tge gain, boos, eq and so many more small fidly bits. Also great. There is one more gripe, however it's more personal. The long press isn't touch receptive, it's distance. And if you raise a hand over you head or chill on your did on a couch and your shoulder gets near em you activate your long press on the volume motion slide.

The Sony XM5's at the time were the best noise canceling over the year Headphones. When Bose came out with the quiet comfort Ultra I decided to give him a shot after my second set of XM5's broke In the same spot. Every review out there said that the Bose quiet comfort ultras We're the best. I purchased the Bose and had them for several days and throughout that time, I had missed my XM5's. Don't get me wrong, the Bose are excellent headphones. They sound great, but their volume is very low. The Sony's have higher volume. They're bass is not as good as the Sony's. The microphone on the Bose for making phone calls is horrible. The Sony XM5 microphone Is incredible. I was standing right next to a power washer, speaking to my wife with the Sony's, and she could not hear the power washer and heard me perfectly. I definitely recommend the Sony's. They are a little bit less expensive and I think they of are of equal or not better sound. Let me restate that. They definitely have better sound than the Bose. The noise canceling is as good or better. No matter what set of headphones that you purchase, I would definitely purchase the extended warranty. I think buying the warranty is priceless. They covered both breakages on my Sony's. When you get to this level of headphones. It really, probably, comes down to the end user. I happen to think the Sony's are a far better sounding.

I sucked it up to make the purchase and I have to say... I LOVE these things. The noise cancellation is fantastic. I love the ability to fully control them from either the app or the headset itself. Calls are super clear.There IS a white noise that plays in the background when you go full immersion, but I don't see how else this level of noise cancellation could be accomplished without some kind of feedback sound.To be fair, my ears do get hot when I've had them on for a fair amount of time. I'm not sure if anything can be done about that since they are over-the-ear, but it would be nice if they could find a good solution.Overall sound quality is as you would expect BOSE to produce.

On the QC45's I knew that one click on each side was the perfect fit, so when I traveled with them and took them out of the case it was a single click on each side and I was good to go.

My old ones were micro-usb....Cons:-I don't like the button layout. My old quiet comforts were very easy to figure out with the slider. I always knew when they were on/ off, and what mode they were in.

The noise cancellation is actually quite good, and I appreciate the “Aware” mode, though perhaps having a noise cancellation slider would be better. Another area of improvement is the distance it can maintain connection. I can walk considerable farther away from my phone and the audio in the headphones remains clear. The headphones are pretty comfortable, thought sometimes listening for long periods of time while wearing glasses can cause some soreness. The battery life is pretty good, though I suggest fully powering off the headphones when done rather than relying on the low power mode. Where this product starts to lose points with me is the auto-pause/sleep feature for when you remove the headphones. A lot of times, this feature will trigger when I’m in the middle of listening to something. Perhaps it’s due to a particular head movement, or something else, but I find myself having to manually resume playback despite not having taking the headphones off. I wish this feature had a toggle as I’d much rather forgo the sleep feature and just power the device on/off manually than worry about whether my audio is going to stop because I looked right.

R3V27GZ2MQ76FU,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to QC35,jharmon,5,"This review is going to be based on how much of an upgrade these are compared to the QC35.Sound: Short answer is they are noticeably better even without the immersive sound option. The bass can “hit” much harder and has a richer deeper sound. I thought that the QC35 did a fantastic job of putting me in the environment of the music I was listening to, but the Ultra’s do an even better job. I like to have a headspace of escape when I use my headphones while I work and these do an even better job. I’ll be honest about the immersive audio feature that I am not sure it’s something I value. I have tried to listen to songs repeatedly with it on and off, it I do not feel it adds much to the experience. Perhaps my viewpoint will change with time.User Interface: The multi-function button has more options than the QC35 button. I like the volume slider vs buttons because it allows you to make smaller volume adjustments vs pre-determine volume adjustments. You keep your finger on the touch slider and move it slowly. I wish Bose had used the touch panel option for the track management like they did on the 700. Clicking the multi-function button 2x to go forward; 3x to go backward. 4x is set in the app whatever you want it to do. The headphones will go into stand-by if you lay the cups flat on a table or surface. The LED will pulse slowly to know you are in stand-by. I have left my QC35 on many times to come back disappointed to find them dead. Then when you pick them up and put them on your ears they come out of sleep mode. USB-C is nice, the QC35 was micro-usb and I don’t tend to use that style of cable anymore.Build: The hinges on this seem to be more sturdy than the qc35. The hinge action is smooth with no clicking. The headband is a bit sturdier as well. The cushions are a bit more stiff than the QC35 so hopefully that leads to more longevity because the older style tends to wear out and you have to replace them.APP: One thing that hampers the QC35 more than the new version of the headphone which I think is the QC35II and later is the options available in the Bose Music App verses the Bose Connect App. The Bose Music has much better fined tuned features with regards to the noise cancellation options and equalizer settings. The QC45 and 700 I know use the Bose MusicMic: I have used this for many phone calls and virtual meetings. I haven’t received any complaints about being heard or being clear.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023",AGOVEPTEREULH6ONEIG6745WD2WQ,True,21,Color: Black

What's that all about?!Secondly, the ANC is fine, but it's no better than my $50 Wyze headphones. Why are the reviews bigging it up so much?And finally the bass. I prefer tight focused bass to boomy flat base. My Bose sports earbuds do the best job of that. These UQ's however sound more similar to my Wyze headphones. Just lacking tightness and character.So that's that. I'm annoyed at myself for not testing these in person first. I'm annoyed that I listed to the 'best headphones ever' reviews. I'm annoyed that these $400 latest and greatest headphones are more closely aligned with $50 set of Wyze headphones than any of my other devices.Go get yourself to a store and try a few, I beg.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AELBTQIU4DWDBM3XILA7T7VCVNKQ,True,1,Color: Black

R195JPWMXEMTMP,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation but not always an upgrade from QC 45,Jeremiah Brandt,3,"I bought the QC Ultra with high hopes to replace my older QC 45 that was starting to have problems. I've used Bose headphones including QC 35 II and QC 45 since 2021. I use Bose headphones because they have good sound quality and are very comfortable. The sound quality and noise cancellation of QS Ultra was noticeably better than the older Bose headphones I used. The comfort of the QS 45 matches older Bose headphones. After using the QC Ultra for a couple of days, I returned them and bought a new pair of QS 45 to replace my older QC 45. Overall the QC Ultra are better is several aspects, but because of the cons listed below I prefer the QC 45.Pros:- Great sound quality: The sound quality of the QC Ultra is excellent. I noticed the sound quality is slightly better than my QC 45.- Great noise cancellation: The noisecancellation of the QC Ultra is better than my previous QC 45. I noticed little difference between my last QC 45 and these.- Very comfortable: The QC Ultra, like my previous QC 45, are very comfortable and I can wear them all day.Cons:- No physical button for volume control: The volume control is a slider. I found it difficult to set the volume to the lowest setting using the slider. Buttons make this much easer because I just needed to click until volume was turned off then up one click.- No dedicated physical button for power: The headphones are supposed to turn off automatically when you put them away. There is a button you can long press to turn off the headphones. I found the long press too time-consuming and found the physical power switch on my QC 45 to be more intuitive, faster, and convenient.- Automatic pauses are unpredictable: The QC Ultra is supposed to pause media automatically whenever they are taken off. I found that sometimes when I'm turning my head or opening my jaw wide the headphones would pause media. This was very annoying. I also lie down wearing headphones on one ear. The QC Ultra automatically turn of media when only wearing one ear. It's possible to unpause media through your phone. However, if you shift your head, the QC Ultra will typically pause media again. This was also annoying and not a problem with the QS 45.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024",AHJWSXX57Q42X4YFS4HLSB3Y7GDA,True,16,Color: Black
R2YP4ID328PUTK,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sounding Bose Headphones I Have Ever Heard!,Aluzion TV,5,"These are simply the best Bose headphones I have ever heard. Usually Bose has made headphones that are lacking in Bass and while that works for a lot of people, it never worked for me. Im happy to report that these headphones have really nice punchy bass and an EQ in the Bose Music App that you can tune these headphones to your exact liking.The app is good and all works well.- The Multi-Point connection takes a little time to understand how it works. You can have up to 2 devices connected at the same time, but you have to stop the audio on the first device before you can start the second device. Once you learn that it works great. *Within the ""Sources"" section of the Bose Music App you can mage all connected devices and I believe you can store up to 8 devices here. Each device will have an On/Off slider that you can choose to have active at the same time as your phone or main device.I like this because I have both of my TV's, My iMac, iPad and phone saved here and can choose which devices I want to listen to by turning on or off that specific slider.- The sound quality of these headphones is honestly what I have been looking for, for sometime.I listen to Dance and EDM a lot and these headphones sound amazing. Plenty of Bass that is clear and punchy. You can fine tune everything within the EQ section of the Bose Music App. This is something that I honestly love about using these headphones. ALL HEADPHONES should have an adjustable EQ that stays with the headphones not just in an app.- The battery life has also been very good no complaints here.- The weight of these headphones is simply awesome for carrying around in my backpack and wearing them. It's almost like you're not wearing anything at all! Very comfortable and lightweight. I use them on the train everyday and I am very happy.- The case is also amazing. The headphones fold down and pack very nicely into this really nicely constructed case. It's also one of my favorite things about these headphones. Having a nice custom case from the manufacturer is where it's at. Aftermarket cases for most things tend to not have perfect fitment or build quality and can be bulky.There’s more but honestly I think I covered the most import things and I def recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2024",AGUIDLDIOAE4GTNEFYZ4HSFY52RA,True,66,Color: Black

Ok I'll talk about the sound quality and features - Wow, wow, wow!! I REALLY love the Immersion setting. Basically, the Immersion setting means the noise cancelling option is to the highest level so the sound is REALLY crisp and no outside sounds interferes with whatever you are listening to. I was really blown away by the musical theater video I was listening to. The noise cancelling feature is REALLY superb. I was also in my room with an air purifier on - which is loud by the way. The Bose noise cancelling feature REALLY dimmed the sound of my air purifier. I would say it blocked 85 - 90% of the air purifier sound. Next are the controls. I've only been using the volume controls and it is the right side of the headphones. It's really cool that it's touch sensitive. There are no buttons - you just slide your finger up and down. The volume control is VERY responsive which is really cool. When I take the headphones off it automatically pauses the video or song (neat!) I like the fact that I won't be ""wearing out"" any buttons. As for comfort I love the fact that it DEFINITELY fits over my ears. I have no fear of pinched ears and lack of blood flow. The headphone pads is very soft, plush and comfortable. I stretched the headphone to its maximum length and it was good for my head. The feel of everything was just slick and smooth . I haven't tested the battery yet. I will update once I do. the case is great and easy to use. It has a hole for the pads which is pretty convenient. I will be using the case because this Bose headphone costs a few dollars. I don't have to mention that this uses USB-C and they provide the cord. I also like the fact that I can connect two different devices. I have android and there were no issues connecting to it but I made sure to download the Bose app. There is an IMMERSION DEMO which sounds VERY cool and you really get to hear the high quality audio features. I had no problems connecting it to my Windows computer. Very happy with my headphones.

Besides, most negative and positive reviews can be fake anyway, lol.I was questioning whether I should buy these or not due to many negative reviews, but then I realized most people only review here to complain, and it’s true that every product has a 2-10% chance of being faulty. Anyway, I’m glad I made the purchase. I’ve had AirPods Max, Sony XM5, and Beats Studio, but so far, the Ultra is a beast and amazing.I can hear every instrument, and the bass is quite good; it’s not overwhelming like the XM5. Like the bass is not distracting; it’s definitely a bassy headphone, but unlike the XM5 or Beats Studio, where the bass muffles other sounds. The immersive feature is a bit gimmicky, but it does surprise me. The volume control is odd I don’t like it, wish there was physical button besides the slider.The weight is amazing, and I’d say it’s probably the most comfortable headphone I have in my collection. I’ve worn it for 6 hours straight studying without any issues. Unlike the Apple Max, it’s definitely lightweight and comfortable. However, the build is very light and plasticky, but it doesn’t feel cheap at all, if you're wondering; it just feels extremely light.Portability is okay; the case is not my favorite, but it does the trick. It’s just annoying that you have to reset the strap height every time you try to fit it inside the case. However, the battery in this thing is quite good, not amazing, but very good. I can listen consecutively for 16 hours with 10% battery left, and that’s with noise cancellation on (your experience can vary depending on the volume you’re listening to; I listen to my music at around 75% to 80% volume) all the time, so yeah, it can drain battery.It’s an amazing pair of headphones, so if you have the money for it, why not?","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,True,27,Color: Black

R26VVYH3J8A929,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best of the Best!,LAMGA1,5,"I purchased the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones from Amazon and am very impressed! Bose has always been at the top of list for the best headphones and these do not disappoint! First off, they are very light and comfortable. The ear cups feel large and the speakers are angled in the headphones to give your ears plenty of space and direct the sound into them. Downloading the Bose Music App allows you to control the settings. One thing I love is the ability to connect two devices via Bluetooth at the same time. For example, you can connect the app on your phone and an iPod or speaker at the same time and control them both.The headphones have three modes: Quiet Mode, Aware Mode, and Immersive Audio Mode. Quiet Mode gives the most noise reduction, and even with a fan or air conditioner running nearby is impressively quiet. Aware Mode allows you to hear what is going on around you and still hear the music. The newest mode and what makes the Ultra headphones unique is the spatial audio feature called Immersive Audio. This mode plays the music as if it is coming from in front of you. You can choose one of two modes: Still Mode for sitting still and Motion Mode for walking or moving around. In Still Mode, the music is always only in front of you so if you turn your head, you hear it out of only one ear cup and vice versa when you turn your head the other way. In Motion Mode, the music is always in front of you so as you turn your head, it moves to stay in front of you. This is by far my new favorite mode.As far as controls, the Ultra headphones only have two buttons and a volume slider on the right ear cup. These control the Bluetooth connection and pause, skip forward, or skip backward. The volume slider is a unique feature that It is located on the right earcup and by sliding your finger along it can raise and lower the volume. I like the idea, but it does not always work well for me. You can also customize the slider so that by tapping it, the headphones will tell you how much battery life is left. Removing the headphones pauses the music and putting them back on resumes it. You can also set the duration for how long until they power off in the Bose Music App.I do think the price point is a little high for the segment; but overall, I really do like these new Ultra headphones and highly recommend them!","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AEWHPVCVF23XWQRIUOMKSVNZG7JA,True,20,Color: Black

Comfortable, great features, and the extra nifty ability to use them with dead battery using an ordinary audio cable.No more with these things! No sound unless power is on, and some genius removed the volume wheel, replacing it with a surface-touch sliding rib. Harder to use - and when you hit bottom of the scale, it doesn't just go silent, it makes a loud CLUNK sound in your ear! LOVELY when I'm in bed trying to fall asleep.But the worst ""improvement"" is that when you poke the button to modify the ANC, instead of quiet-to-loud beeps, you get an annoyed robo-lady who snarks ""AWARE!"" (for ANC off) or ""IMMERSION"".Ugh.

RV4F83P5684M0,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Sound great but not good for a small head,Chris,3,"These are extremely comfortable to wear and they sound great once you use the EQ to reduce the bass. The stock EQ curve is really bad in my opinion. After just a few minutes I had them sounding great. The spatial audio isn't great, however. Pros mix albums of music to be listened to in stereo, and it's best to listen to it the way they intended. This spatial audio is interesting but it's a gimmick.The dealbreaker for me is that these do not clamp on my head much at all. They move around when I turn my head or look down. They move around so much that it makes a loud sound when I try to move at a decent speed with them on. I would like to be able to do a light jog with these on but there is no way I could hear the media while jogging due to the headphones bouncing up and down on my head. Earbuds are much much better for me. Maybe my head is smaller than I thought. If you have a small head, don't buy these.They did not disappoint in terms of comfort, ease of use and sound.

R1VCE67YU7ENPU,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose Does it Again,Elaine,5,"Let me start by saying, I am an audiophile and I am constantly trying new headphones and new audio technology. In my opinion, Bose still stands far above the competetion in most catagories. The crisp sound, unmatched comfort, and superior noise cancelling set these QuietComfort Ultra headphones apart from everything I have used. I travel a lot for work and I am constantly grabbing this headset for the airport, loud flights, and just leisure music listening.Design:As you take the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones out of the case you will immediately note that it has the same sleek curves and overall clean appearance of a Bose product. The case fits the headphones perfectly with enough room for small accessories like a charging and auxiliary chord.Comfort:These are easily the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever used. The ear cushions are made of the distinct Bose memory foam and they are fully adjustable to any head size. I wore them on a 8-hour long-haul flight and my head didnt hurt or have suction/red marks from overuse. I was incredibly impressed.Intuitiveness:The controls and simplicity of the button layout is something that I really started to like. The volume is a simple swipe up or down on the side of the headset and the multi-function button is intuitive and does exactly what you would expect. I found that using the app for things like connecting bluetooth and adjusting sound modes worked better than pressing buttons on the headphones themselves.Battery Life:My only small complaint is that using Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) and playing louder music, the battery tends to drain somewhat faster than I expected. After a full charge I find that the headset will drop to 60-70% fairly fast. That being said, the battery has never run out on me, not even once.Noise Cancelling:This headset is far and away the best noise cancelling I have ever experienced with headphones, and I have tried all the major brands. I would say the ANC is slightly better than previous generation Bose headsets. Also, I did not notice fatigure or ANC induced headaches, which is a huge plus. I feel like you can literally enter your own quiet world in a busy space like an airport or aircraft, and for me that is everything.Overall:This headset is the marquee of excellent sound quality, unmatched comfort, and the best noise cancelling on the market. The headset looks great on your head and sounds even better than it looks. Bose does it again.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2023",AGFNIYBZ7EMW3CTBLV2E75KRRI3Q,True,129,Color: White Smoke
RK19PT2S7F9,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars My New Fav!!!,Josh L.,4,Only used for a few days but higher impressed already. First thing is that the sound is amazing! First pair of Bose headphones so my comparisons are with my previous Sony XM4s and my brief try of Airpods Max from my friend. Noise cancellation is amazing and I say slightly better than Sony but again this is the XM4 I used not the new XM5 so I had less of that white noise swoosh sound used in that mode. Transparency also impressive sounding natural and again a step above Sony but still believe Apple leads in both features. Now sound yes like the ability to custom EQ and played around for the sound and like it but Sony does have more presets and EQ bands and bass adjustments so wish Bose had more of that but still got the sound that worked for me. The headphones are also comfortable but wish they extended the headband just a little more and slightly bigger earcups but over a few days just had to break them in for my ears and get used to wearing them. Also great that they fold and the nice case and the new XM5 doesn't fold and bigger case so that's why I didn't upgrade from XM4. Another con is wired mode has to be with headphones on with battery so that's sort of new with wired supposed to work without power as backup. These still are now my main headphones and will for years but again updates for more EQ settings would be nice.,"Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AHJWDUM5GCWRL3FLEMJYU3WJ3OHA,True,3,Color: Black

Just to be clear, I still love these headphones.The Bose QC Ultra has a feature where if you take one earphone off your head, they auto-pause what is playing. I don't personally like this feature because sometimes I don't want to pause when I take one cup off my head. I would rather always press a button.A second small gripe I have is that these earcups are a bit more hard than previous iterations. I have a pair of QCII's and I much prefer the soft comfort of those earcups to the slightly more firm padding on the QC Ultra.The final thing is the volume control. I am not a fan of touch controls and they have decided to go with a touch slider on this iteration. If my hand is a bit sweaty, it will stutter along the surface for inconsistent volume control. I would rather have physical buttons.Other than these small things, this set of headphones is superb.

As an avid music enthusiast, frequent traveler, and love of movies in a loud and busy household, these headphones have improved my audio experiences in ways I never knew were possible.First and foremost, the noise cancellation is unparalleled. The moment you put these on, the outside world fades away. However, it still offers the ability to be aware of your surroundings when needed without stoping your audio. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment.Comfort is another standout feature. In my use case, I am wearing the headphones for prolonged periods of time, and most of the time you almost forget you have them on. However, the new head-on detection is really cool. The moment you slip the headphone of your ear, your entertainment pauses, and then when it is back in place, your entertainment seamlessly starts back up.If you are traveling you don't need to worry about the headphones going out on you, because the battery life is incredible. As with all Bose products the craftmanship and quality is top-notch. I have been hesitant to purchase Bose headphones in the past because I just didn't think that I would be able to tell enough of a difference. I was wrong.Overall, you will not be disappointed with these headphones, the only minor issues that I have run into are the fact that Bose utilizes two different apps to control their devices, so I was previously using Bose Connect, and the headphones require Bose Music. And although you don't really need the app once you have set them up, it would be nice to have that experience streamlined. I have also noticed that sometimes a new blue-tooth pairing can be a little finicky, but overall is very good.I am beyond excited to have these headphones, and it has added so much to my entertainment enjoyment.","Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2023",AGVE2CUYS4QEWISNATJ422HF3BIA,True,6,Color: Black

It is a solidly built headphones. There is no question about the quality and that premium feel.2. Sound is a bit better than qc45, sony xm4, and xm5 (yes, I have tried those as well). Immersion audio mode is excellent.3. Confort is where it didn't work for me. I use headphones for long hours for work. And I need something that sits on my head without causing too much ear pressure or the pressure on my eyeglasses. But this one does. The clamping force is enough to cause discomfort in approximately 30 minutes.So my recommendation is that first try them before you buy them. :)","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AHEUCKCVZE5X74LKAEMQ7VZLQCRA,True,15,Color: White Smoke

Here’s what I experienced before returning them the next day:- The Bose app’s main use was toggling through the three listening modes. It has few features and is annoying to use each I need my headphones. Lose the app.- Pairing with iPhone15 pro max was simple. After that, the headphones refused to pair with other devices—permanently—repairing was constantly required, even with my many other Bose products- Function buttons on the right earpiece are difficult to find and easily activated with unintentional touches. It’s hard to say which is worse, the app or the analog function keys. I have large hands so finding and using the tiny main button and even smaller bluetooth buttons was challenging.- Saving the worst for last, and this very likely was a factory defect, but the maximum volume of these headphones is lower than my small ipod pros! A strange volume control bar on the right earpience is a bit sluggish, but the problem my set had was volume that would not go past “medium” on most other headsets.- I eagerly await Apple’s AirMax headphones.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AG2ELZHO6QIAYX7DQ7OMQZPD5ZCQ,True,3,Color: Sandstone

I road trip a lot with children and needed some quiet time to get some work done, and my husband works in an office where he is constantly doing virtual meetings. These headphones have made both of these things a huge upgrade! The different modes are helpful as well. In the car I had on ""aware"" mode and was able to hear if my kids were asking me for something but could not hear that my husband had some music playing on the radio pretty loud. So crazy how you can hear one thing but it completely blocks out another!I wanted to learn more about the immersion mode so I downloaded the app. I usually don't like downloading an app for every product I have, but the demo was so useful and it explained how immersion mode works and OH MY GOSH it is so cool, it really makes you feel like you are actually seeing someone perform live.We had some confusion connecting them and learning to switch back and forth between different phones at first but it does get easier. The fact the headset only has two buttons makes it a learning curve at first to remember how many times to push the button for answering calls, ending them, skipping forward a song, skipping backward, etc gets a little confusing but once you have it down its hard to forget. My husband said they work really well for his business calls and he can hear clearly and his co workers can understand him very well. Only complaint would be I found they put too much pressure on my head that I could not adjust away. I was constantly pulling a side up to relieve the pressure, so long term use isn't for me but I was the only one that tried them in my family that had this problem. Otherwise they were quite comfortable! Overall I am very happy with this purchase and plan to use these for work and for fun for quite a while.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AEP2PIDEKJGG5Q7D7H2L3DX2NZ2A,True,9,Color: Black

I guess these cushions fall apart after some use and you've got to be extra careful with them. Keep that in mind if you expect ruggedness. 4 stars overallUpdate: it doesn't really matter how good the noise cancelling is if the things don't last, and both of the cups are falling apart after 4 months (see attached image). By contrast, I Sony's lasted several years without any major issues. I've tried contacting Boae support but they do not make it easy to contact them. It's kind of a joke for what I paid for th3se headphones that they are falling apart in less than 6 months.I've had the Sony WH-1000XM4 for a few years now and compared side by side, these Bose are significantly quieter. I tested various things like A/C units, loud neighbors, fans, music and these simply block a lot more noise. I don't know how these compare against the WH-1000XM5, but online reviews say the Bose have better noise cancelling, and that was enough to make me switch to Bose this time. Comfort, connection, battery and less important stuff to me seem good so far, so I'm happy with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023",AFHI3W5K6BXRQ6GFNPK2FT7JGPCQ,True,4,Color: Black

The Bose had crisper and clearer sound as well as the perfect amount of bass vs the Sonys.Noise cancelation was amazing. I laid down on my bed to relax with the Bose on quiet mode. I shut my eyes and a few minutes later I was jolted by my daughter trying to talk to me. When I took the headphones off I realized that she opened my door, walked into the room and up to the bed and began speaking to me and subsequently yelled at me. It wasn't until she physically touched me that I knew someone was in the room with me. Most definitely amazing noise cancelation.As for listening to music for long periods of time these performed great and did not cause any discomfort to my ears. After a few minutes you don't even feel that you are wearing headphones.These fold up easily and store perfectly in the included case. I tried a week of the Bose and a week of the Sonys and the Bose are the clear winner in my opinion. I would most definitely recommend and I'm very happy with these for every day use.

R1M1D37NWQU1NK,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Not the sound profile for me- vocals felt subdued,david,3,"A subjective review, I mainly listen to ballades, classical, krnb/kpop, jazz… so i prefer somewhere close to the harman curve.I own hd 800 s and the airpods pro 2nd gen. I wont compare them to the 800 s because the price difference.Comfort- no complaints 4.6/5. Just got a bit warm due to me playing at higher volume because i want to hear vocals.Sound- some people say that its loud and some people say its quiet. I realized why people say this. Vocals are quiet, and almost become less present/more muddy when the volume is turned up. for me, the dip in the lower treble/high mid bothered me extremely, the sole reason im returning them. I prefer there not to be a dip there so that vocals are more present. For example the airpods pro 2nd gen/hd 800 s do a much better job at this region. And even though i tried to eq through bose app, it did not fix the dip present in the vocals. If you like to to listen to ballades, jazz, or anything with a lot of singing and instruments, i wouldn’t recommend them for this reason. The airpods pro 2nd gen have much better tuning sadly. If you dont listen to vocals or dont care if they are prominent you might like these. 2.5/5Connectivity- i like that you can connect to two devices at once, it worked smoothly. 5/5Packaging-sucked, ugly box, not that it matters.Anc- quite good, 5/5Immersive audio- horrible compared to what apple has going on, not to hate. There is a crazy delay when using the motion mode, and still mode lowers sound quality, so its useless. 0/5Value- uh i think 2.5/ 5 its good for its anc, though i think anc has gotten good across the board, so I dont really care.Style -4.5/5- i find them to look niceTldr: don't like the tuning.

ROM93HGP49ETL,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars A great successor for my QC 35,LouRevue,5,"I've had the QC35 for years now and it's always been my go-to headset. For all-around purposes, the QC35 was the best for both music, conference calls and phone calls. I have a pair of Sony MX3's that I use for music since it has a little more bass to them than the QC35 but, overall, the QC35 was my favorite. That said, it's almost been 4 years now and it's starting to show some wear and slowly dying on me. Time for a new headset so I went for this new QC Ultra and I'm more than satisfied with this one.Music wise, it's better than my Sonys. I did have to tinker around with the EQ a bit but I did manage to get a setting that I really like so I may just need to retire my Sonys too. For conference/phone calls, this thing is great. Easy to pair with my home/work laptops and sound and voice clarity is crystal clear.The big thing was the updated ANC. It's much better than the QC35 and the immersion setting it fantastic. Really makes the sound come through clear without any weird distortions or anything.Fit/form, these actually fit a little better than the Qc35s did. They're a big more snug, in a good way, and don't get as loose as the QC35 did. The older style buttons have been replaced with more streamlined buttons and there is a volume slider neatly integrated behind the right ear cup. Battery life is supposed to be around 24 hours but we'll see how that goes.Overall though, a really nice upgrade from the QC35.

R1GJYGGW89PVXO,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Sleek comfortable Headphone with Multipoint,Normal Consumer,5,"I've owned many headphones, earbuds, and a few noise-cancelling over-the-ear headphones like this Bose one. By far, this is the best looking and comfy headphone that I've used. I love that it features auto-on and power-saving mode when putting it on and off, so I don't have to worry about keeping it on and coming back to a dead battery. Bose's noise-cancelling headphones are known to be popular amongst those who travel frequently in the airplane rides, and while I haven't had a chance to test this in the airplane yet, it completely blocks out ambient noises like my AC running, neighbor's lawn mower, etc. Without any music playing, I'm able to hear my family conversing in the same room, but still works well. New feature called the immersion mode, is quite cool. It makes the sound more hollow as if you're in a bigger space, so that it feels more like it's coming out of the space you're in. The head-tracking mode is super interesting as you turn your head, but I don't think I'll use that feature much. My favorite part of this headphone is the multipoint. It lets me connect to both my laptop and my phone, and depending on which source is playing sound, I'll be able to hear without having to disconnect and reconnect. I wish all bluetooth audio devices supported this feature! As shown in the photo where it's folded up, I feel like a pouch might be easier to store instead of the zippered case that came with it. While it does a great job of storing it, having to align the orientation to make it flat takes some time getting used to. My head's circumference is about 59.5 cm and I have to extend the headphone all the way to fit my large head but I imagine it'll work well for most people with average head size. I'd say the headphone is definitely on the pricy side, but it's definitely a premium device that many will enjoy using.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",AFKNSDC6PPBLSXII6YLA5GBXOXJQ,True,28,Color: Black
