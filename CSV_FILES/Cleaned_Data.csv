0,R1192BYGQG4BDU,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sound and comfort makes them worth the high asking price,JD,5,"I have spent months (years, really) of research searching for the perfect set of no-compromise, best-at-everything bluetooth ANC headphones at any price. I've bought and ended up returning a couple sets that each disappointed in some way or another, and had essentially given up on such a headset ever existing. My priorities are (in order): - Sound (including high-bitrate bluetooth codecs because I prefer to listen wirelessly) - Comfort (especially over many hours on long flights) - Active Noise Canceling (ANC) - Call quality - Quality-of-life features (I like buttons, though I know some prefer touch controls)The recent wave of ultra-premium headphones (Focal Bathys, B&W PX8, M&D MW75, Mark Levinson No. 5909, B&O Beoplay H95, etc.) got my hopes up, and while I don't think any of them truly hit that ""no compromise"" standard, the PX8 from Bowers & Wilkins came *very* close, and for me is the best on the market at any price (as of fall 2022).~~~Sound~~~First and foremost, they sound incredible. My wife has the Sony WH-1000XM5's and while those sound great (significantly better than their Bose counterparts, imho), the PX8's blow them out of the water on clarity and separation. I won't try to write up a full audiophile description of the sound because there are plenty of more qualified ones online, but I will give an anecdote: without telling her which headphones or their price tag, I put these on my wife's head and played a song she loves and has heard many times (instrumental metal, if that matters). She listened quietly and said ""It sounds like I'm hearing this song for the first time.""Also important to me is the fact that the sound is on the warm side and easy to listen to for extended periods. I am sensitive to high-frequency sound and often have problems with sibilance or a ""sharp"" quality to high end audio equipment that strives for upper range extension. These have plenty of detail in the highs, but none of that sharp quality that I personally find irritating.~~~Comfort~~~The other area that the B&W PX8's really shine is on comfort. I have big ears that stick out a lot, and many over-ear headphones press my ears down in a way that gets uncomfortable. My wife's Sony XM5's are a great example - because they have such stellar ANC I like to borrow them for flights, but I can only wear them for a couple hours before my ears get physically sore. The PX8's have no such problem. They have large earcups, and the angled drivers create a deep space in the back that gently cradles even my Dumbo-esque ears. I keep finding excuses to wear them, because they just feel so good.~~~Active Noise Cancelling~~~This is why I say they aren't truly ""no compromise"" headphones. The passive noise blocking is quite good, and the ANC is effective at cutting down outside sound, but it isn't class-leading. The Sony XM5's, Bose QC45's, and Apple Airpods Max all seem to do a better job of creating that total Cone of Silence I crave on long flights. This is a common trend among the most premium audiophile headphones though, and some companies have said that there are engineering trade-offs that have to be made between sound quality and ANC. I'm not sure I'm totally sold on that narrative, but if slightly weaker ANC is the price of this glorious sound quality, then that's an acceptable trade in my book.~~~Call Quality~~~Very good, my voice can be heard clearly. Not quite as good at blocking out background sounds as the Sony XM5's or my Jabra headset with a boom mic, but perfectly adequate for the situations I need.~~~Features~~~I love the well-made buttons (I live in a cold weather climate where touch controls are less than ideal), and the app is refreshingly simple. It doesn't have some bells and whistles (no adjustable ANC, limited EQ options, no voice detection or automatic situational awareness), but it has what I need and works well. The only exception here is on-ear detection, which is finicky and frequently pauses the music even on ""low"" so I had to turn it off. It's not a must-have feature for me but might be more bothersome for some.Edit: another issue I have noticed after a couple weeks of use is that the ""skip backward"" function doesn't work very well. In theory you can skip backward with a triple-press of the multifunction button, which I do often when I want to go back a few seconds in a podcast, but 80% of the time it either skips forward or pauses instead. Not a huge deal, but annoying.~~~Summary~~~Best-sounding, most comfortable bluetooth ANC headphones I have ever tried. Other features aren't necessarily the best among the competition - in particular I wouldn't mind having stronger, adjustable ANC - but they are more than good enough, and all together I think the package justifies the high price.",11/3/2022,AFN2EZ7N6BTU2AC46T4DIF5S4JAQ,1,133,Color: Black
1,R3H8WCKL01KGN9,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Superb detail and clarity. Excellent build quality,BigGinge,5,"I was growing frustrated with my Sony WH-1000XM4/5's constantly losing their settings (randomly enabling Speak-to-Chat was particularly annoying, so though I'd try the B&W Px8'sThe Px8's might not have the touch/swipe gesture features of the Sony (which I suspect was the cause of many of my issues with the WH-1000XMx's), but this is a very minor gripe and the button controls for volume/pause/next /previous etc. work very well.Sound quality is on another level when compared to my Sony's. Clarity and detail is fantastic and I'm hearing new detail in recordings I have been listening to for years. I've also compared to my Sennheiser Momentum (wired / no-noise cancelling) and Momentum 4 (wireless / noise cancelling) and the difference is just as stunning. The Sony may have more features and tech (360 sound, ear shape analysis etc.) than the Px8, but where the Sony relies on its tech to enhance audio, the Px8's rely on higher quality components and less ""processing"".Build quality is also superb. These are easily the best built headphones I've owned. Top quality materials make these extremely tactile. They feel slightly heavier than the Sony's in my hand, but they are far more comfortable to wear.My ears would feel ""pressure"" when using the Sony's for extended periods of time. I do not get that the the Px8's.Despite the gripes I had with the Sony's I would have recommended them to anyone looking for a decent paid of noise cancelling headphones. Since getting the Px8's, I'd suggest spending / saving a little more and getting the PX8's or even consider the PX7's which have a similar construction/sound.",06/7/2024,AE7TFCX7HWKKUCNMKUWHNC7DGB7Q,1,1,Color: Black
2,R37L2Z72FO4L3G,B0B349KKSV,"1.0 out of 5 stars No warranty, no support, torn headband",Paul H. Anderson,1,"I wanted 2 things from my headphones. First, the quality of the sound. Music needs to be deep, rich, balanced, with a nice presence. Secondly, they needed to be comfortable. These headphones rated high in both areas. Now that I've used it for about a month, I can say it really delivers in both areas. I'm glad I have it.You'll notice I didn't mention noise reduction. I don't need that, working from home. I don't ride public transportation, so I don't need noise reduction. I've tried it and found it to be acceptable. It will fit my needs on the occasional times. I've read others are better, but I bought these headphones to listen to music, not silence. And they are great for that.I've heard that the speakers needed to be broken in. That is true. Right out of the box, the sound is okay, but not worth the dollars. So I connected my phone, set it aside, and let it play all day. Every so often I would listen to see how it was going. Every time I listened, it sounded better. After about 8 -9 hours of play, I pretty much got the sound I had paid for. It improved a little after that, so they sound great now. If you buy these, be sure to give it time for the speakers to reach their peak. You won't be sorry.**********Follow up after 9 month's use:After less than a year's use, the cushion on the headband pulled out as seen by the photo. Since the headphones were supposed to have a 2 year warranty, I contacted B&W for help. They told me that because of who I purchased the headphones from, they would not honor the warranty or help me. They told me to contact the seller. I sent the seller an email, but never got a reply.Yes, the headphones sound great. But for the amount paid, the quality of the construction is very lacking, to wear out after less than a year. Worse, despite what B&W says, there is NO warranty and NO support from the manufacturer. They simply won't stand behind their product, as my experience and their comments show. This is inexcusable for a company with their supposed reputation and for the high cost of the headphones. I strongly suggest you search elsewhere for a better built product from a company that will stand behind their products.",03/3/2023,AEKE54FRSPNDPL7KKIQ6MYPVXLLQ,1,55,Color: Tan
3,R3N0NRYLQ62UOG,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sound but not perfect,Aaron S,5,"My headphones arrived in new condition and were as expected for a new product. They came charged at 50 percent and it took about 45 minutes to charge to 100 percent. The most important thing to review is the audio quality, and I can tell you that the audio is crisp and punchy as you would expect from Bowers & Wilkins. Trebles are excellent. Bass is a bit muddy especially on older recordings and could use some improvement. Overall, these are good enough to go ahead and sell my AirPods Max.What I do not like, is the wear sensor. Even on the lowest sensitivity, it causes music to randomly pause. This is very disappointing and for 700 dollars this should not be a problem. I decided to turn the wear sensor feature off, as it is useless. Comfort on my head is good, and wearing long-term they are very comfortable. I do have the experience of the headphones sliding around on my head when bending over or moving slightly, and this seems to have to do with the shape of the headband and how it rests on the head. This needs improving but is not a deal breaker.Vocals sound especially good, and instrumentation, especially jazz sounds incredible. Percussion parts sound just ok, but I would like those frequencies to have more presence. As I mentioned before bass sounds a bit muddy and I was able to improve it by adjusting the iPhone EQ settings and the bass setting in the B&W music app.I totally recommend these headphones. I am very pleased with my purchase, and I can't stop listening to my music collection all over again and hearing it in a new way. Addicting sound.I am very pleased with my purchase.UPDATE: The issue with the wear sensor being too sensitive has been resolved with a firmware update.",09/24/2023,AET5VCKVEYIUNFVEKNXECOIDLHEA,1,19,Color: Black
4,R2LPNJL3WGT49E,B0B349KKSV,3.0 out of 5 stars Great If you know what to expect,Ring ding,3,"I purchased these anticipating that they were going to replace my open backs the Hifiman Sundaras and my AirPod pro 2S. Something with such a luxurious sound that none of my headphones would be able to compete. But the px8s are far from that. To get my actual issue out of the way, the apps battery life report is useless and inaccurate. It said the headphones were at 37% then a few seconds later, 15% then 0% all within a minute. After a full recharge and only trusting the Apple widget the battery life tracked just fine. So I believe the head phones were fine it was just the app. Now to sound quality. I was shocked to hear that no joke my AirPods have more bass than these closed back headphones. Don’t get me wrong the px8s are super clear and have great treble, imaging, and decent mids. But without any real low end even after EQ they are lackluster. It really leaves a sense to music that it’s just straight up missing something the soul of the song is gone. That may be I’m just open back spoiled. But there were many times I thought to myself wow I’d actually enjoy this more in my AirPods, and which I did. If you like very technical sounding headphones with little bass, then these will do it for you all the way since the detail is simply amazing. But if you want something that can be a do it all headphone these are not it. I recently demoed some HIFIMAN EDITION XS’s and they actually sound pretty much exactly what I wanted the PX8s to sound like. Sound so good you set through music you’d never listen to because the quality of the sound makes any genre and song intresting to listen too. From bass to treble the edition XS’s do it all beautifully and are cheaper than the px8s!!!!!! Yes they are 2 completely different headphones, one for on the go, and ones just made for home. But if your in the search for the best headphones, and thought because they’re B&Ws they had to be amazing, I just have to let you know these are not it. I know you can’t really demo these things anywhere, and reviews on YouTube are all over the place in the comments. But all I gotta say all the “negative” comments in reviews of the PX8s are true. I also forgot to mention but with ANC and pass through, when I turned my head they would make this very high pitched noise, even after updating them to the newest firmware they continued to have a weird high pitch feedback when turning you head with ANC or Passthrough on. But yeah that’s my review. I’m only being harsh because they’re pricey! $700 new on their website. With what I experienced and listed to, wired to a dac on my pc and Bluetooth, I would have kept them if they were $200.",12/9/2023,AFB6R6B3XN2XS6V4OO6UISXTWCPA,1,11,Color: Black
5,R1JD8F8TV02AJZ,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars I really didn’t like them at first!,PiperFlyer,4,"When you spend a bunch of money on something and don’t like it out of the box, you get that sick feeling of disappointment in your stomach. The box arrived and I was super excited. The quality of the packaging, the smell of the of leather, the quality heft of the build material…oh, this was going to be great! When I linked them using the lossless cord set up and started to listen…dead…flat…boring…DISAPPOINTING! I messed with he EQ, pushing the settings to extremes and back. I quickly grabbed my Sony XM4s, then my AirPod Max and even my old Beats Studio 3 for comparison. ALL SOUNDED BETTER…ALL of the them! Even my ragged out Beats! The the hell? I went straight for break in mode. I hooked them up to an old iPhone that I converted to an iPod and set up a play list of big bass Megan Trainer, Bruce Springsteen “Jungleland” for the screaming highs of Clarence’s sax (sadness filled me as I remembered his passing), Gran Bel Fisher’s “So, Wildly” for some rest. I added some INXS, Bleachers and “The Smile has Left Your Eyes” but Asia. Man, that song has a lot going on in it! Then, I let them run for a whole battery cycle. I let them rest and charge for a few hours the then tan them another…then another…then another. Okay, now we are getting somewhere.After some serious break in time, they are really starting to sound really, really good.My assessment is this. When you build a headphone set like Sony, that are designed to sound good out of the box and deliver slightly sloppy bass, you don’t need to really break them in much. But if you buy something that is built to replicate sound with more precision, you’ve to to build them a little better and they may need to break in. As these are breaking in, I’m backing down the treble and bass and I’m starting to hear some of the musical instrument separation and sound stage that some reviewers mention.Losses vs Bluetooth. Yeah, they sound better wired to my MacBook or iPad and that’s a great way to listen to them but that is not a practical way to live with them. Does that make sense? When I want to really enjoy some HQ Lossless music, I stop down and listen but this morning I did some housework and they sound really good over Bluetooth. They are a little heave compared to Sonys but not too bad.ANC. Not as good as Sony nor AirPod Max but a close third. Very close and interestingly, better than Bose QC45s.Comfort. Not as good as Sony or Bose or my Philips open backs. About the same as AirPod Max. Way better than Beats Studio Pro.Weight. Kinda heavy feeling. Similar to my AirPod Max but the AirPods distribute the weight much better. After wearing these for an hour or so then putting on my XM4s, the Sony’s feel crazy light!!Sound. Balanced compared to the treble heavy AirPod Max, balanced. Compared to the heavier bass of the Sony’s mellow and smoooth. Compared to open backs, focused and deliberate. Compared to Beats Studio Pro…well a lot sounds better then Beats (but I like my Beats). Non-music audio. Awesome! I stream shows and football games and Formula1 races over my AppleTV or iPad and spoken audio sounds so much better on the PX8 than most of headphones I own. The Sony’s are boomy, the Beats sound muffled in comparison. The AirPods Max are the only ones that sound as good and maybe a tad better.WEB REVIEWERS!! That’s another thing. How can someone on YouTube pull a set like these out of the box and give an accurate review? They can’t! Use Caution when listening to them unless they clearly talk about break in.In closing, as The Beach Boys Sloop John B plays in my ears, I have gone from having my finger on the return button to gripping them tightly in my 54-year-old hands. These really are great and a wonderful addition to my growing collections of headphones.",09/23/2023,AGXYBAI6TANWRZ2Z3K2AJ6REMICQ,1,33,Color: Black

There is a clear difference between the Px8 and Px S2e - anyone considering spending the coin on the Px8 is likely to notice the difference.

9,RZVJYEV2CN7QR,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound Quality for Wireless Headphone. Period!,ND,5,"I am an audiophile and have owned Sennheisers, various Bowers & Wilkins PX series headphones including the latest PX7 S2. From a travel standpoint I have owned all the last four Bose headphones - QC 25, QC 35, QC 35 II & NC 700. I have been searching for a headphone that is comfortable for travel, exceptional sound quality and good noise cancelation... in this order of priority. The Bowers Wilkins PX8 fits this three criteria perfectly. Sound quality - it is fast, drum beats reverberate naturally and sound astoundingly real... the speed of the carbon drivers are unreal, you have to hear it to believe it - the frequencies decay so fast... nothing trips up carbon driver of the PX8 - metal, symphony, dance, deep bass music - I have tried various genres over the last two weeks to see if there is some kind of music that will trip up this headphone and have found none... this is the only headphone that I have owned where I look forward to wearing it everyday when I take the dog for a walk and it is like carrying your stereo listening room right around your head. The sound stage, placement of instruments, and overall sound quality is just astounding. Noise canceling is not as good as Bose; I'd rate it 3/5 for noise canceling as tested on a plane. The pass through & aware features are very nicely implemented. It is comfortable because of the nappa leather, the PX7 S2 which is the exact same design was not as comfortable because of synthetic surface, but nappa leather PX8 makes a massive difference in terms of comfort. After four hours of flying the PX8 was still supremely comfortable with no pressure points on the top of the head. If you like sound reproduction that makes you want to listen to music over and over and tap your feet to the music and enjoy the emotion of music... this is the only headphone that delivers it all - comfort, noise canceling and just astounding sound reproduction. If you not into sound quality or an audiophile, I'd recommend getting the Bose QC 35 II. But if you are an audiophile that is looking for exceptional sound quality, the Bower Wilkins PX8 with its amazingly fast carbon driver is the epitome of wireless headphone for sound quality - period... full stop... the end... as audiophiles would say, this is a 'musical' headphone; you have to hear it to believe it.... 100% worth it for $700. Simply a brilliant product by Bowers & Wilkins, and I can see why Bowers & Wilkins believes that they can charge $700 for it; because it really is that amazing.... no exaggeration. You have to hear it to believe it! AAA+++",10/26/2022,AHCTJMSEWPZ7HY4L7NGMZIWJWNUA,1,35,Color: Black
10,R1SLZZIULUHGPJ,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars Phones are Great. App sucks.,D. Bellino,4,"These are very transparent and very enjoyable to listen to all kinds of music and movies. The EQ adjustment is very good. It’s dead silent. They are very comfortable and I have big ears. The pass through is good. The problem there, though, is if you lean on the back of either ear it makes a sort of white noise so resting your head and turning it isn’t ideal. The noise canceling is good.It’s just the app that sucks. It disconnects. It takes time to connect when it should connect automatically when the phones are on. The volume level of the spoken voice telling you it’s connected or disconnected is WAY TOO LOUD. There are times when you have to reconnect the phones seemingly for no reason. I don’t understand how such a great company can put out an 2nd rate app. If not for that, I’d give 5 stars.",12/24/2023,AERWW2CC7LTULWCCI6IYE6IQRNIQ,1,0,Color: Black
11,R37JRBEZZ9FTV3,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it worth it?,XStar-Infinity,4,"It truly depends what genres you listen to. I've been using the Sony Xm5's for the past 3 weeks using an iPhone. Today I got the Px8's delivered and I wanted to test them out on both iPhone and with an Aptx HD device so i went and bought another phone that supported it. The one thing that stood out immediately to me is that music from the Px8's don't have the spacial 3D sound effect that the Sony's do. On both the Aptx Hd device and the iPhone they both had the same style of sound just somewhat more enhanced on the Aptx HD of course. I personally listen to Hip Hop/ Rap the most and to be honest, I genuinely like the Sony Xm5's better because of the Spacial 3D Reality audio effects. How would that sound descriptively? The best way I can put it is that the audio in the Sonys sound more like your listening to music from a speaker outside of you but with very clear detail how as the Px8's just hit you directly with the sound. I feel pulled into the music listening to the Sony's how as I feel hit by the music through the Px8s. This has been my experience listening to Hip/Hop Rap music. I did tune to Rock and a couple other genre's and there is beautifully sounded music that includes actual instruments, but still not 3D spacial audio effects that's vital for me personally.As far as the build and comfort go, THe Px8's dominate the build as they feel very professionally designed compared to the more plastic material from the Sonys. When it comes to comfort, they are both equally comfortable in two different ways. The Sony's are loser whilst the Px8s are more snug, but both feel comfortable. I would probably say the Px8's feel better to wear but if you like the earphones being looser around the ears, the Sony's are that.I would say if you don't mind audio not having more of a 3D feeling to them, then these may be worth it. I'll also mention, the Px8's had a more clear vocal sound and sounded like the artist was closer to you than the Sonys did.",10/25/2022,AHZMS5IHZYE6OPXSFS2L4ZL6D6TQ,1,38,Color: Black
12,R30MPYTY0GOA82,B0B349KKSV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic, beautiful, Top Quality Headphones",Mahajo,4,"No doubt these are fantastic headphones. Top quality build, beautiful sound, super comfortable. I also own the Px7 S2 headphones, which are also great. The Px8’s are better, definitely, but the differences are subtle. Is it worth the extra $300? That depends I guess. Once I tried the Px8’s it was difficult to go back the Px7 S2. The sound is more refined and detailed and the build quality, with the aluminum and Napa leather making them even more comfortable. Also, a recent update on the Bowers & Wilkins app fixed the performance of the wear sensors on both sets so the auto-pause/play now works exactly as it should. These are the most comfortable, best sounding headphones I currently own (including the Sony WH-1000XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4, the Bang & Olufsen H95 and the aforementioned Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2’s. My only complaint is with the noise cancellation, I really wish it was stronger and also the bass can distort a bit at high volumes on some tracks and I can’t increase the bass level more than a notch or it becomes an issue, but overall the bass sounds fine (if you like bass I recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones, the bass is thumping!). Now if these were lower priced, say $549-$599 I think it would be fully a recommendation I could make without any doubts. But at $699 it’s a tougher sell. If you are reluctant to spend that much, wait for a sale or go for the lower priced Px7 S2 headphones, those are a better value. But if you want the best, then go for the PX8’s. I think they will prove their worth in the long run! They are simply gorgeous headphones!

13,R2GPQXQWTEULOJ,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing after properly broken in.,A. Salazar,5,"When I first received them I was kind of disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away given the price. But when I put them on and went through the usual test tracks, I kind of regretted spending so much on something that sounds just kind of ""meh"".So, I put them in the living room to listen to the TV when I wake up early to not bother anyone sleeping figuring they would work great for that, even if a little overkill. A few months later, I decided to use them for music in the office for a few days just to see if the ANC would work well enough. I put on some music and wow! I could not believe how good they sounded!As mentioned in other reviews, it seems breaking in with this set is critical. Something I had gotten use to not doing with other headsets and ear buds. Go figure. But now I like them so much, I actually ordered a second pair while on sale for black Friday.For ANC, they are decent. Not as good as the B&O H95s I auditioned at their store in NYC - those have the best ANC I have probably ever heard. But the PX8s are still good enough for general office noise. And the H95 have a very narrow sound stage to the point it actually sounded a little left of center which I confirmed with another pair there - strange.Battery life is very good as well. I have never fully ran them down but have not really tried.So, ya, they are a great headset once ran in.

15,R2G5F0NMN19VXX,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars The best headphones I’ve settled on!,Sergiu Arsenie,5,"So these are my go-to headphones and I’ve had many pairs. I bought the Sony XM4s, the Sony XM5s (earbuds and headphones), the AirPods Pro 2s, the AirPods Pro Max, the Bose QuietComfort, the Sennheiser HD660S2 (these along with an amplifier came closest to the PX8s), and various other cheaper Skullcandy earbuds. The PX8s are amazing. RICH bass without being overbearing. Perfect when syncing it up with the TV or PC, but you can’t appreciate their full potential if you use them with a phone that has an inherent sound limiter. They are LOUD and clear with no distortion even at max volume. I have a ~2500w sound system in my car with all the bells and whistles and these headphones seriously remind me of that. They also are extremely easy to sync with any device as it’s recognizable immediately. I have no negatives to complain about.

16,RDW2WJWVPBYEY,B0B349KKSV,4.0 out of 5 stars On the fence on sound; Bluetooth connectivity is useless.,Alex,4,"The sound of this unit deserves the plaudits it has received, but I'm not sure its audiophile quality. For this price, I'm still on the fence, although I'm considerably enjoying it.The Bluetooth connectivity is awful. It does not connect automatically to my iPhone or iPad. Even when connected, the app does not recognize the unit without prodding and fiddling, so it is not possible to apply the noise cancellation without effort.I think the noise cancellation of the unit has been understated by the reviews, although I take at face value that it is not as good as other headphones in this class. It does meet or exceed the strong cancellation on my airpods pro.Back to the sound -- I'm having trouble figuring out what works best. Over Bluetooth, the sound achieved by the three modes -- noise cancellation on, NC of, and passthrough mode -- is different. It seems like the ""off"" mode gets the worst sound, and the passthrough mode is best.For wired mode, I'm getting a bassy, boomy sound so far.The comfort of the unit is quite strong.The Bluetooth issues may be what pushes me over the edge in returning the unit. It's far worse that cheaper headphones I bought years ago. That it will not connect automatically to even one device is ludicrous.If this unit were $300, it would be a no-brainer despite the problems, and I guess I take the various YouTube videos at face value that the sound is best in class. But at this price point, it certainly deserves some scrutiny .",11/21/2022,AFQMOZJXXBMYETRNKH7UZV32NUMQ,1,21,Color: Black
17,R156JNPELR9P9F,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful luxurious sound,Pete Uballe,5,"Very impressed with the B&W PX8s. They look and feel incredibly well built. Beautiful to look at. I got the royal burgundy color. Gorgeous. Right out of the box, they sound is impressive. I would say the sound is also luxurious. They have a deep detailed texture with beautiful clarity. Listening to Michael Franks' ""The Sound In My Head"" and Diana Krall's ""Live In Paris"" was amazing. It was like I had never really heard those albums before.I had previously ordered the Focal Bathys. And they sound fantastic as well, but I had to return them. I believe the design of Focal's headband is seriously flawed. I own a pretty good sized collection of headphones from many different brands and the Bathys are the first headphones that have actually caused some serious pain to the top of my head. It brought on headaches and dizziness. And this is after wearing them for only 20 to 30 minutes. On the other hand, I have worn the PX8s for 2 to 3 hours at a time with no problems whatsoever.So, I'm very pleased with my purchase of the B&W PX8s.",01/3/2024,AHPZUSH25PE4Z4IRNMDU56N3DPXQ,1,5,Color: Royal Burgundy
18,RH98JS8TM3LBH,B0B349KKSV,5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely a Keeper,chchon,5,"I bought these to replace my Sennheiser PXC 550's, which were still working but seemed dated after six years. The Px8's are a noticeable improvement-particularly the sound, which is superior for a blue-tooth headphone. These produce great detail, balance and sound stage. I particularly enjoy how they bring vocalists to life (I listen to classical and jazz primarily). They also are most comfortable, with spacious ear cups and just the correct clamping force. All this noted, they are 100 grams heavier than my PXC 550's so I noticed the extra weight immediately.So what is my recommendation? If you can afford the extra for the luxury experience, go for it. If you are a daily commuter or student, who uses these on the go and need top-end phone functionality, go for the less-expensive and lighter Sony, Bose, Sennheiser options. The Px8s would be perfect on a cruise or an occasional airline trip, but less so for daily highly mobile usage.But if you want to kick back and enjoy a luxury experience at home or on an occasional trip, seriously consider these. I should note that I compared these to the highly regarded Focal Bathys blue tooth headphones. Indeed, the Focal Bathys are wonderful products, and they do present slightly better sound by audiophile standards (that is, clarity and sound stage). Yet the Px8's were more secure, comfortable, offer impressive clarity and sound stage, and generally provide a more pleasant presentation and listening experiences. In particular, the Focal's crystal-clear treble came off as harsh to me (and my wife and sister in law). So, headshape and ear sensitivity may lead to different conclusions among some, but the Px8's really hold their own among the very best wireless headphone experiences.",02/18/2023,AHK5TOIJMI3Q3REHZDIZUTGDZ5MQ,1,9,Color: Black

It’s certainly not the most technologically advanced headphones and they are pricey. Build quality …excellent. Comfort…definitely… they have a luxurious feel to them. Features … basic… most headphones in the sub$400 category have these features and more. Battery life seems adequate. But the sound…. My Sony XM5’s were kicking butt… until these broke in. Started with everyday music SZA.. Arianna… etc. but they all have properties too close together… went to Mozart and Vivaldi. These definitely found their legs after about 15min. And suddenly the Sonys were …meh and made me question that purchase. Noise cancelling…. They’re quite good comparable to Bose and Sony. My B&Os still sit atop of that list with great competition, just a step or two behind. Just my preference. Slow starter strong finisher. Beautiful headphones great sound.

The Bluetooth call volume (other end) is very low based on multiple people’s feedback. Reached out to B&W and they were less than helpful. In digging into reviews, this is a common problem (design not problem).If you are into good sound and looking at the price point and Bluetooth calling isn’t important to you, these would be good. For me this was a deal breaker and I would expect the BT calling to be decent given this price point.

Listening to Beatles, Tull, ELO, ELP, Santana etc, etc. I say life is short so go for it and get a pair. I have NO adult supervision and the cats said it was OK to get them. ENJOY!PS. I have 11 B&W speakers for surround sound. the M-1s, 600s, 700s and the 803s. Good enough for the Beatles and Floyd at Abbey Road. Good enough for me.

I've owned the PX7 and the PX, (both sold) as well as the PX7 S2 (currently own). The PX8 is in a category of its own vs the other B&W headphones I've owned. I didn't buy it for the ANC though its more than adequate. I didn't buy it for phone conversations or web conferences either, though its more than adequate here as well. I bought it for the sound, the comfort, and the quality of the design and materials. Paired with a high res streaming source (I use Qobuz), and a device running Android and supporting the AptX adaptive bluetooth codec, (not that easy to find but they exist), I'm having a wonderful time of it exploring much of my favorite music all over again. It is stunning. The PX8 also works well with lossless streaming, a DAC and the USB C to USB C cable that's included when connected to my laptop. I've now winnowed down my headphone collection to the PX8 and the B&O H95. Both offer their own unique, quality listening experience.

Rather every sound is clearer. You can hear every note, guitar pluck and string vibration. It’s amazing.They connect easily to multiple devices at the same time. This can be a bit annoying if it decides I want to listen to my phone instead of my computer but it’s an easy fix. I’d rather have this than my old headphones that didn’t want to connect to anything.They’re so comfortable. I almost forget that I’m wearing them.

The sound was clear and the fit was snug but not too tight. App was easy and intuitive and I had my myriad of devices using the multipoint Bluetooth in no time.But that’s where it ended. As soon as I hit the road I knew these weren’t from me. With full NC on, standing in the boarding queue, I could hear the guy behind me crackling his plastic water bottle. When I turned on spatial awareness to hear the boarding calls, it was like being on a phone call with everyone around me! On the aircraft, these couldn’t even drown out the engine noise and I could hear the people next to me talking as if they were talking to me.I have used a variety of headphones including Bose, Surface and AirPods Max and they all do a way better job at much less price. I was expecting a lot more for my $650!!Unfortunately these have to go back. So if NC is not important to you, perhaps you can pick these up on Amazon Warehouse at a bargain.

The rotating dials are best feature of the headphones. They sound is almost perfect for closed back headphones. They are more clear than the B&W. The bass has a punch and fullness.

Now six weeks later and getting no response from my last e-mail. I called their customer service line again. I had to fight with customer service representative just to speak to a manager. Not that it helped, all he kept saying was he could not answer that.

Within months, new separations opened up. Instead of a sleek black, the neon yellow foam was all that was visible.Attempts to contact customer support were fruitless. I received a blanket refusal to service them even having been a customer with them for over a decade. It felt like desperation of a failing company with a poor product.

On the iPhone the phones sound good but are hampered by lack of a bluetooth codec that can do them justice. Apple uses Bluetooth AAC and that is just not capable of the fidelity offered by Apt HD codec the Fiio uses. On it the headphones sound spectacular with very good and deep bass and great soundstage. Believe most Android phones can support that codec and some newer and even better ones.The headphones exude class and are very comfortable.

I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!",09/11/2023,AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,1,344,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
101,R1MZVYL3ULXVYC,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars The King is back, for a niche audience",Apple nerd,5,"I loved my Beats Solo headphones as a teenager. I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic. I absolutely love these - and am so happy I got them!",09/7/2023,AEUHSKBV2ADJTTXVB55RN7UQQZTA,1,359,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
102,R2TKWVR4L10Q0W,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good and an honest review,Jeffrey K.,5,"I bought my beats studio pros (blue) as my old Bose Headphones died. Bluetooth linked perfectly to my devices. There is some audio lag (latency) if watching video (similar to all other audio devices I've used). I personally love that it comes with a 3.5mm audio cord. I used that to watch video on my computer. It saves battery and with the cord there is no latency. Sometimes it is just nice to have a corded headphone. Without the cord, the bluetooth range is pretty good.Sound quality is very good and I am most impressed with its ability to do DOLBY ATMOS. Make sure the content you are listening to is formatted for ATMOS and that your phone/device has atmos turned on. It makes a big difference. Bass sounds good and deep but maybe a little less than expected for Beats. Volume turned up loud did not make crackling noises or become distorted. Battery lasts a decent amount and nice to recharge by USB (goodbye batteries!). Noise cancelling is pretty good too and with audio playing it gets rid of any outside noises.Some people complained about the comfort and their ears hurting. I have not experienced this. The ear pads are pretty soft and your ear (mine at least) fits INSIDE the padding verses ON my ear. I can wear for hours and have no issues.Overall a well made product that sounds great for $200 (Deal Price). I'm happy with it and my beats studio buds!",04/12/2024,AEKNOXKFYEIDCUI3EPV3XUTZPHBA,1,37,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
103,R3RSUGFYRCGKOF,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Good Quality.",Spazzola,5,"Well, after having lost one of my AirPods (gen3) and not being able to justify purchasing a replacement left pod for $90, I started doing research.I came across these beats studio pros and looked at their stats. 40 hours of play time? Probably the most enticing thing about them to me. Then came the active noise cancellation, and spatialized audio. ANC intrigued me. I wanted it to be better than the AirPods at cutting out sound. While I was looking into these I happened to be doing it during Black Friday deals. Which meant I thought they were $170, which was the price of brand new AirPods. Then I saw their original price of $350. Which enticed me even more in a way, thinking of the price tag fallacy, higher price must mean quality. I mulled this over and over and eventually ended up missing the half off sale. Then I knew I wanted these babies. I watched and waited for a sale to come up again. I was not willing to pay $350 for wireless headphones, as I am not willing to pay $350 on just about anything, but thats just me. For me, $179 is splurging significantly. I caught another sale. I bought them and hoped for the best.I will have to be honest in saying I was hesitant to stray from AirPods and move over to headphones. The less I have on me the better, so having something sit in my ear rather than over my head appeals to me. But having my device constantly slip out of my ear or feel unsecured was not enjoyable. That’s how I lost my left AirPod in the first place. These headphones feel sturdy for me. I was pleasantly surprised. Although I still did not particularly care for a bulkier heavier device, I did appreciate their securedness. They do eventually make my ears sore but I usually just adjust them. I will not count this against them because every pair of headphones I have ever owned eventually made my ears hurt or gave me a headache. Im sensitive what can I say? The padding on the top band that goes over your head was a nice touch.The ANC is powerful. I loved being immersed in my music. I have no complaints really.Spatial Audio… I personally could care less about it, so I don’t have much to say about it. I just don’t use it as a personal choice, not saying it isn’t good.The sound quality seems adequate to me.The volume is pretty great, I never have to have it all the way up to get clear sounding audio or to feel like I can actually hear something. Which with my AirPods was a constant problem.The mic on these, I am thoroughly impressed with. Compared to my AirPods, its like award winning lol. People on calls usually can’t tell I am using a headset at all.I’m not sure how long it truly takes to charge them, as I haven’t charged them from dead to full yet. I imagine from the little bit of charging I did do when they first arrived they will take a little bit, but to me it’s worth it.Overall, I feel my money was well spent on a good product. I got a better bang for my buck with these beats than I did with my airpods. The compactness of AirPods are nice, and I like a compact item so having a larger device is something to get used to but I still think it’s worth it.",01/15/2024,AFGMDHUXSF76BWEEVF5IAL7E6NKQ,1,62,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
104,R19726D1M2NGAW,B0C8PR4W22,"4.0 out of 5 stars An expensive, high quality headset with some pros, and some strong cons to consider.",Weave™,4,"Beats has been around for quite some time, and has developed a good reputation alongside Bose, Sony and others. So I was excited to try these out - especially after my experience with Anker.PROS: the sound quality is very good. Not Bose good, but close. Close enough for airline travel. The headset rests on my big head with no issue and the pressure from wearing them isn't uncomfortable.I like the Transparency mode, especially when travelling, so I can hear the crew announcements easily.I also like that it comes with a 1/8"" audio male-to-male cable for use on airlines with traditional audio jacks.And - controlling the headsets using my iPhone is a nice feature.CONS: The perceived air pressure on the eardrums from full noise cancellation is STRONG. Almost uncomfortably so, and you'll see similar comments from others here in the Reviews section. It takes getting used to. I almost sent these back, but in the end, the pros outweighed this issue. You may find it too much for you.Expensive: these are pricey, and if you're going to drop this much coin, you should at least try the Bose QuietComfort cans first. While they'll lack the iPhone integration, they may end up being more comfortable for you.Bass: ummm - where IS the bass? These are Beats, right? Studio Pro edition? I'm not really getting the lower frequencies here. Maybe I missed a step during setup. The sound quality is good but I thought a lot of Beats' reputation was based on the bass.All in all, I mostly don't regret my decision. But definitely try more than one model before you decide for sure.",03/10/2024,AE66YM6J42DY23ARCZVC74NSZSAQ,1,88,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I bought on sale with the fear I'd have to return them. Surprisingly, they are excellent; the sound, including bass response is rich and vibrant without the curse of booming bass. I wear hearing aids behind my ears and the cups fit over them very nicely, boosting the sound as needed with earpiece controls. They are also very attractive and fold into the included case for carrying. To nitpick: the ear cups could be a bit larger but suffice.

107,RDHOFA7MKRYPL,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars THEY DESERVE NEGATIVE STARS,Warning Please Read!!!,5,"Please read this review if you are thinking of buying g these headphones!!!!! They are on sale for a reason, and it’s not because they are good or even meh. I compared them to my old Studio 2’s from 2013 (11 years old) and they are horribly different.I had high hopes for beats since I use the fit pros, and boy was I disappointed. More than disappointed I was let down. I still have my Beats Studio 2’s from 2013 the silver titanium color way, and I’ve loved every minute of having them because of the loudness and club-like thump they have to them. They are relatable to one of the cars that passes by you with the windows shaking because the bass is so hard. Especially after 11 years that they still work and function the same as they did when I bought them minus a few cosmetic defects. So with high hopes and promises that these Beats Studio Pros would be just as great, I ordered them and got the maroon color because I liked the color. I should have known that if the colors have to be nice to make up for how awful the headphones were I wouldn’t have even glanced at these.These headphones are great if you want to listen to something and you have a hearing aid so it doesn’t hurt your ears. The sound is not nearly as loud as the 2013 model and being 11 years old I was very surprised. Apple has ruined the name Beats and all of their headphones minus the earbuds since all earbuds are relatively the same(I have the fit pros now and they are great) but the fact that brand new headphones can’t outperform 11 year old ones is just sad. Disappointing. A let down. I was thinking the new model would be the same if not better than the old ones I have since the treble and mids may have changed in the time I’ve had the headphones but I was so wrong. They sound almost the exact same with one major difference. The bass. The one thing that I feel most people loved about Beats was the bass and how it would sound like you just walked into a club when you wear them. I was utterly distraught. The studio pros on Bluetooth were so bass negative I thought I didn’t have the volume all the way up. Once I realized I did I thought maybe it was just the fact I wasn’t using one of the ‘3 specialized audio modes’ that the new model has. Even there I was let down. I played different songs, tried different audio settings on my phone like bass boosted and acoustic and rock but none of them helped the headphones. So after all the thoughts that went flooding through my head, one thing stuck out. Apple had ruined the classic Beats headphones. Don’t get me wrong the sound of the treble and mids was fine but still nothing compared to an 11 year old model. I was highly disappointed overall and would not recommend these to anyone even if they have an unlimited budget. It is just not worth the letdown.",03/28/2024,AFDOLKER2GHNCK53GDAR2YNQPMVQ,1,74,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
108,R2UXJLAZR33T40,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.",06/15/2024,AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,1,0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Normally, I would not spend the money on these because they are expensive, but my husband bought these for me as a gift and they are the greatest gift ever. Use these normally when I go to the gym to tune out to any clinking weights and just so I can focus on my music or podcast. But the game changer is when I use these for daily chores while my kids are napping. I can still listen to music that I want, and listen to a podcast WHILE I am vacuuming and I don’t miss a thing. These are also great when my husband gets home from work and I’m trying to put dinner together together. I put these on and I can tune out the noise and the kids so I don’t go insane.

110,R3REKPIFS6TC75,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Review And Comparison To The Sennheiser Momentum 4,vladislav grutsenko,4,"Highs: Beats > Sennheiser.High frequencies are good in both headphones, but Sennheiser has them more emphasized. Sometimes it feels like if you crank them slightly higher you're gona hear sibilants. It's on the edge and this is not the most pleasant edge to me. However, the sound is accurate and somewhat distinctive in the upper-frequency range for the Sennheiser. As for the Beats, highs are as detailed as on the Sennheiser (if not more) but not overemphasized.Mids: Beats > Sennheiser.Sennheisers have a so-called v-shaped sound profile so it feels like Beats have way more mids. It might be even too much at first, but you get used to it. Beats are more detailed and fast. Sennheiser feels muddy in comparison (but still very precise and detailed compared to Sony and Bose). I think it's partially because of overemphasized bass that brings distortion into the mid range. You start hearing things that were not originally intended to be there by artists. Because of this, Sennheiser sounds more ""musical"", it fills the voids between the instruments and produces an overall ""dense"" sound. And the Beats have more reference sound. For many instrumental tracks (rock, metal) Beats might sound boring and hollow. I can't blame the headphones because such music is usually mastered to sound good on consumer electronics. And you can't put good ""dense"" sound into an average stereo system. It will sound too muddy and.. just bad. So they leave the voids between the instruments and try to separate them. But on a reference headphone, this sounds... well... too reference :)Electronic music is a completely different story, this is where Beats shine! Electronic sounds are way more precise. And with Beats, you get this precision (especially in the complicated EDM tracks; I mostly listened to psytrance, psychill, idm, etc. But an average techno/trance sounds good as well). Sennheisers sound fine too, but only until you compare them with Beats.Bass: Sennheiser > Beats.The Beats are precise, again, and so is the bass. If the bass was intended in the music that you listen to - you will hear it. And you will hear exactly as much as it was planned by an artist. Rap songs sound great because of that, as well as some EDM tracks with massive sub-bass. As for the Sennheisers, well, they are v-shaped still so they add a subtle amount of bass to the overall mix, and in most cases, this sounds fine and even fun. It also comes without surprise that in bass-heavy rap songs, it starts to sound too overemphasized. In terms of precision, Sennheisers are not as precise but still hold their ground well against sony/bose/etc.Soundstage: Sennheiser > Beats.Soundstage feels subtly more open on the Sennheisers. Probably this is because they are not as precise and produce more ""parasite"" harmonics that make instruments sound further from your head. I like this effect but this makes me wonder if it's possible to achieve a good soundstage for closed headphones without compromising the sound speed and precision.ANC/Transparency: Beats > Sennheiser.Beats are slightly better in noise cancellation and noticeably better in transparency mode. Not as good as AirPods Max, but kinda close. Sennheiser is not bad though, it's just not as good. Wind can be a problem for both headphones, but I don't care. Beats are better at blocking fan noise but may overemphasize it in the transparency mode.Mic: Sennheiser >> Beats.Sennheiser microphones are superior both in terms of volume and quality. Beats is really mediocre, on the edge of what I would call ""usable"" for the zoom meetings. On top of that Beats mic sounds really quiet in Windows 11 rendering itself useless. I hope new firmware/drivers will fix that.Ergonomics: Sennheiser > Beats.I like Sennheiser more. Beats have smaller earcups with stiffer ear cushions. Also, the clamping force on my average-sized head is obnoxiously strong. Not to the point when I feel a headache after wearing them for a few hours but still too much in my opinion. However, I like the fact that Beats are more compact. It makes a difference when I listen to them in bed, for example. They don't rub as much against the pillow and don't produce a lot of noise like Sennheisers.Sennheiser ear cups are rotating 180 degrees when on the Beats, they barely move. This is important if you want to move one headphone back to open your ear when you need to listen to somebody or something from the outside world quickly. Or if you're a DJ and need to hear monitors with one of your ears :). Sennheiser earcups pivot and stay perfectly adjacent to your head, unlike the Beats.Connectivity: Beats > Sennheiser.Both headphones are ok when you're near the source, but the Beats stay connected longer as I walk away from it. The usable distance is like ~30% longer. They also perform better for a source behind a wire mesh or a security door. I know that Sennheiser is capable of working with 2 devices simultaneously and this works pretty well. Not sure about the Beats but I don't really care...Controls: Beats >> Sennheiser.Beats are very basic. They don't even have a head detection. And this feels soo good after the glitchy Sennheisers! You can read more details in other Sennheiser reviews, but they are really bad in that aspect. I bit the bullet and used them as my daily drivers, and oh boy... settings were getting changed randomly, I had tons of fantom head detection events, and when I wanted to put them on or off I almost always accidentally touched the right earcup sensor and triggered something (usually play/pause).",07/22/2023,AHW6Y7QXQTDZZQHKFGWJCKTN66BA,1,257,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

First of all the great premium package, and the bag they bring is great. I have NEVER worn a headphone that has this sound quality, i was amazed the first time i tried them. SOUND IS CLEAR on the iPhone is everything so smooth, has automatic sync, has spatial audio, basically is a surround sound on your ears. Amazing technology for the price. My family once they tried them their reaction was priceless.So yes would i spend 400$ for this or more, definitely yes, it's a win win!, will update as i need to try them at the gym, but I'm sure they will be to notch with the ANC they transport me to pleasant land.

They are beautiful they look great. Comfort is about an 8 out of ten but I can hardly hear because the volume is very low. Am I missing something? Maybe I’m doing something wrong but if it is what it is than it is not very trustworthy to sell a product that doesn’t do the most important thing it was created to do. Besides the fact that I have to sit in a quiet room to actually hear on them. Is that part was different this product would get a definite 10/10 from me because the sound is crisp. The all around quality of the product is very high all the way down to the box and zipper bag it came in. The texture of them is so comforting I love it but I am definitely conflicted*update-It did get better after I plugged it into my device. Pairs easily with all my devices flawlessly.

113,R3564JH9C37XMR,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars They are not pretty, but do get the job done",Guard,5,"These headphones are brown. Not very attractive, but they do an adequate job at cancelling outside noise and they have excellent sound quality. I am a music snob and I work from home. My wife also works from home and we have two teenagers that are either playing or bickering constantly. Putting on these headphones with white noise, jazz, or some other style of music allow me to completely detach from whats taking place at home and focus on my work at hand. Also, I can participate in conference calls and video chats with ease and without interruptions. When I need to practice (I am also a musician) I plug in the cord (included) to my Nord Stage 3 88 keyboard (essentially an electronic piano), and I am still oblivious to what's happening around me. Occationally, like when I have something cooking in the oven, I have the headphones on ambient mode and I can clearly hear timer in the kitchen go off. It is worth the buy if you catch it on sale.

114,R1HAR6IQABGEHG,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall not too bad I guess,Ashley M.,4,"I'm a stay at home mom and I was given these (my request) for mothersday. I'd like the highest level of noise cancelation to be better. I can still hear my kids when it's on, not as well as when it's off but I expected it to be better because of the price. But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones. If you don't mind hearing some noise all the time and just wanna drown out smaller back ground noise, have a small head/ears, enjoy a little less bass then these are great for the price.",05/16/2024,AHGBWUQCNMQ2NZBJ4ZPFFNHVNCTQ,1,1,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Bluetooth works well but will randomly switch to my iphone handset when on a call. Left earcup clicks when my jaw moves like when chewing or talking, have to make slight adjustments to where that ear cup is on my head to resolve the clicking when it happens. It is a physical issue with where the ear cup meets the band, I assume at the pivot point, causing the clicking that I’ve read many others have experienced as well. Disappointing for the price and being an Apple product but overall still decent and much cheaper than airpod max’s if you want a set of affordable over the ear headphones that play well with iOS.",07/2/2024,AHLXPJMU2VWR7M4WSMJ7P373EOJQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
116,R3JIPAMQMANNYP,B0C8PR4W22,"5.0 out of 5 stars Clarity in sound, Comfort on head, Connecting Devices",Floweringplum,5,"These headphones are nicer than I expected. The cushioning is a very high grade plastic which is comfortable when the headphones are being worn for hours at a time and they are secure. I wear eyeglasses and I use these headphone when I am on my laptop watching a movie or videos on Youtube. The area where the eyeglass arm rests does not hurt but my ears will get warm and I take the headphones off for a few minutes to let the air circulate at the ears to cool down, this for my use is the only negative. Otherwise these are a nice upgrade to the $60.00 or less headphones. I was able to use bluetooth to connect to my Apple devices. However, I have encountered a snag to be able to connect to my Samsung tv that is connected to a wireless soundbar which I am still investigating. In the meantime I am enjoying and glad I purchased these Beats headphone and they were marked down making them a good deal. I would recommend and give as a gift. There is a lighter weight more recent version of these Beats at a lower price.

But very noticeable have better sound quality than the AirPods Pros 2. The other good thing about these, these can last for 40 maybe 40+ hours. Either way, these are amazing. The only downside about the beats studios pros, is the phone call quality. Its a major step down, from the AirPods pros 2. Also, when trying to connect these to the PS5, PlayStation wireless bluetooth functionality seems to only be limited to their only products. And sadly not third parties accessories. So for the Beats Studio pros, Id recommend still get them. And if you workout, want some headphones in the gym?

At any rate, they're comfortable enough for a two hour session which is what I need.The sound is pretty great compared to most headphones in the range.

Good noise canceling quality depending on the volume of the music you listen to. If you are streaming shows, you can still hear things in the background. When I first got them I was disappointed that I could still hear things with them on. I was hoping for more noise canceling power but with music playing, noise in the background isn’t too noticeable.

Typically it isn't easy to amplify all sounds at the same level and get clarity. Beats headphones have conquered this feat just like Bose. The noise cancellation filter is of good quality, canceling outside noise to bring clarity to high frequencies, midrange frequencies, and bass frequencies. This quality product will last but must be handled with care; support is available for troubleshooting if needed by Apple. The convenient Bluetooth feature allows connectivity to any smart device.

124,RZGEO464CSXFR,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product for the price,Eric,4,"After using the best studio pros for a while, I can definitely say that these are basically the Apple AirPod max’s but for a quarter of the price which is an amazing deal for the quality of headphones you are getting.Apple owns Beats and you get most of the features as if having AirPods and the accessibility of using them with iPhones . If you have an iPhone and pair it with the Beats Studio Pros, they will automatically pop up on your phone to connect like aipods do. Some of the same features include: being able to switch transparency/noise cancellation mode through your control center on your iPhone, Spatial Audio, Apple chip, ect. It is also lighter than Apple airpod max’s which is a huge plus for staying on your head. It includes an easy control system on the left ear on the headphones to allow you to play/pause, skip/go back, volume up/volume down, accept call/end call which is nice to be able to change the volume on the headphones which is something AirPods can’t do. They are very comfortable and sort of glue to your head and ears. You can adjust the headphones to fit to your liking as well. The color ways and the matte accent makes these headphones look slick to wear and overall they took out some small Beats decals on the previous headphones to make it look clean.Some flaws I have for the headphones are 1. That when you take them off your music will not automatically pause. This makes you take a small little step in either pausing the music on your phone, through the headphones, or continuing to play the music. I like how on the AirPods they automatically pause when you take an ear bud out so I wish these headphones did the same especially when Apple owns them. 2. They could be a tad louder. Don’t get me wrong, they are overall loud headphones but you have to get over half way in the volume to notice a loud change. Below halfway seems too quiet to me personally. 3. The case it comes in is slick, but the zipper design is annoying to get the headphones in and out of the case because the zipper hole is too small. Also the case is soft shelled and not hard so it’s not as protective as I want. 4. It’s a fingerprint magnetOverall if you are looking for high quality Bluetooth headphones, these are the best bang for your buck. Yes there are some flaws to this product, but the price is too hard to beat. These easily are the same audio quality as the airpod max if not better at quarter of the price. The design of the Beats Studio Pros have a better design than the max’s so I’d definitely suggest getting these if you want to save money.",01/13/2024,AGNFNGIJ4UL3ZZAKLWLBZ4BGPDMQ,1,8,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

When these went on sale at a fantastic price, both I and my husband bought them. (We are betting Apple will soon update these and have some feature we wish we would have liked, as that has happened to us before!) In any case, the headphones we packaged and shipped promptly after ordering, and arrived in perfectly new condition, and were the exact set I expected. There was 80% charge at delivery. The cord to charge was included, but I had to raid my old iPhone’s charger to actually plug it into the socket—be aware that the charging portion is NOT included in the set. This is not a big deal, as we have several chargers from older Apple products. But if you do not have Apple products, you will need to buy a charger.

They have pretty good noise cancellation when wearing them (you can still hear some things but not so much so that it's distracting if you're trying to focus on something- working out, working, etc...) and the sound quality is pretty good. They're also pretty comfortable on my ears (they do fit good inside them though so they aren't squishing them- I'm not sure how comfortable they'd be if your ear doesn't fit inside them).

For being ""studio pro"", this is a big downside.Trying to find a 25 foot cord that will squeeze into that hole will be a hassle for sure.Other than that the only other downside is that switching between ""eq"" settings requires you to use a double ended USB C cable and I'm not sure if that only works while listening from the cord connected device.They sound good and are comfortable though.Id be way more upset if I paid the full 350 dollars for them.Luckily I got them for half of that, so I suppose I will have to make due.",05/18/2024,AGMKVZMDNH6AQI4UCDPNDKO6PJMQ,1,2,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
129,RTHIK4B0U8KXP,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than expected,hhoffa,5,"Everything about these are perfect so far. They cover the entirety of my ears so they don't press on the cartilage causing pain (especially since I wear glasses). They have 3 settings for sound, ""noise cancelling"", ""off"", and ""transparency"". The noise cancelling still lets sound in when nothing is playing from them, but when something is playing you can't really hear anything outside unless it's super noisy. Off makes it be just like a regular pair of headphones, and transparency is actually pretty amazing- put them on, nothing playing, and in this mode you can hear everything almost as perfectly as if you didn't have them on. When music is playing you can still hear some stuff from outside, but you still have to pause it to hear what someone is saying though.I bought an off brand pair of headphones for $25 in October and the pairing and ease of use was actually kind of complicated. BUT THESE. These are so simple, I love it. They also connected right away.My only gripe is maybe it could stay on the top of my head better, but I think that's because of how fine/thin my hair is and everything just falls off it. It's great that it's smooth, but because of it, even the gripper thing on the head part can't compete with my hair 😂(I own an android and forever will, these work great with them despite being an ""apple product"")",04/16/2024,AHZFNBRVXADZFCDDK3RTOOR7TL2Q,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

They were a bit stiff and uncomfortable at first, but after a few days of wearing they stretched out a bit to fit comfortably over my head. The active noise canceling is excellent.They do lack a key feature that I had with my JBL headphones. I cannot pair to 2 devices at the same time. I work from home several days a week and am on a lot of Zoom meetings. In between meetings, I listen to music on my phone. I end up having to either toggle back and forth between devices or listen to Spotify from my laptop. Workable, but not ideal. Additionally, there is no tone to indicate that I successfully turned on the headphones. I can’t always tell if they are on unless they pair to a device. This doesn’t always happen automatically (probably because I regularly toggle between 2 devices).

My priority was noise-cancelling, as I am sensitive to all types of unwanted sounds, like someone talking on the phone at the office, or construction noises in the building, etc. I have had Sony, and I had no problem with noise cancellation. It was super cool, I could just turn off my nerves and work, live, move, do sports, etc. Beats has waaaay worse noise-cancellation, in the background in all modes I still hear what is going on around.The only things that is better comparing to Sony, is the stronger construction, for gym it is a plus.All other options Beats is worse. Sony is a winner.It is also a discomfort while switching between connected devices, take several some time till the headphone understands that it has to play on another device.Anyway, if I had to buy this at its original price, I would not do that. Not worth it.If I was an iPhone user, I would take AirPods Max, if no compatibility issue, I would still take it.So, if ANC is important for you, here is the list of winners:1. Apple AirPods Max2.

155,R3PKX54VHP9QXO,B0C8PR4W22,4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones,margaret juarez,4,"I haven’t own a pair of headphones this is my first pair so my review may be biased on the quality of the headphones from sound to design but I have asked people around that have own many pairs of headphones for their opinion about this set and I will be incorporating their opinion on the sound.These headphones sound very good for its price, I was looking for something that wouldn’t break the bank (I’m a broke college student), have good sound quality, and noise cancellation. I wanted something to block out the little noises and hustle and bustle when I study in the library, in a coffee shop, at home, or outside. I read a lot of reviews from different sites and watched videos about the beast pro before I committed to them. What was important for me besides the sound quality was how good the noise canceling was. Many said that for the price it was a good head set for its quality, it was equal to the the quiet comfort 45 Bose headphones.Now the sound quality in my opinion is good, I will say though that for classical and R&B music it doesn’t give it justice. You can hear the music just fine but when you are in a noisy environment, even with noise cancellation, you have to put up the volume to hear lower and softer melodies. For more up beat music the music sounds better especially like pop, rap, country, etc. There isn’t a lot of base but you can control it’s sound, you just have to have the iPhone 11 or 12 and up to do that, I have an SE 2nd gen.The opinion that I have asked of others are an overall 7/10The battery life is amazing, it last for long periods of time, for 10 hrs of music straight the battery holds to a good percentage. If I hear for a few hrs of music a day for a week, I don’t have to charge it until the next week. And it charges so quickly too, it takes up to 30 min to charge full.I like how it have its own pouch to store it in with its adapters and charger, and have an extra zipper pocket to store in anything extra.Overall these a pretty good headphones if you don’t want to spend over $300 for a pair.",01/1/2024,AFJACG5ME2ZWJUUIUIXBOYBEYPKQ,1,6,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I don't use headphones a lot, generally when traveling which I only do a few times a year. I am traveling overseas this summer and wanted some good head phones for the long plane ride but just couldn't bring myself to spend $400. I was eyeing this on Best Buy's website when they went onsale for $199. I wanted to double check Amazon and found an even better deal from Amazon Warehouse for $150! It stated the box might have some damage but the headphones were brand new. When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see everything was in great shape. I've only had the opportunity to use them 1 day but so far I am very pleased! The sound is great, the integration with my iphone is great! The noise cancellation works very well, however, it gives me some anxiety being totally deaf to my surroundings so the transparency feature is perfect for me.

167,R19FNCEBWTLWCK,B0C8PR4W22,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and Noise Canceling!,Zack,5,"These headphones are everything I dreamed they'd be. Many people have told me I could find the same quality or better for cheaper, which may or may not be true, but I'm honestly glad I got these. (They were on sale anyway).Even though I might agree they're overpriced, they really are outstanding. I don't know that much about sound quality, and the differences that exist between products, but if I could describe the sound coming out of these headphones: I feel like I can hear every cord on guitars, every beat on drums, and the very vibration in my favorite artists' voice while they're singing. This is of course all further improved by seemless noise canceling.Obviously, it would not be possible to block out every sound (like the insanely loud truck horns when I go outside to take the trash out), but I will say my family members have had to SHOUT to get my attention at times lol. And I mean they were seriously screaming bloody murder. I really don't hear anything but music when I have these things on and in noise cancelling mode. In fact, at one point I had them in transparency mode without realizing and I could hear the ambient noises coming from TV still (which is what alerted me to them not being in noise cancelling), so I switched them back in the app and the sound from my TV was cut out completely in a second. I'm not going to lie, it impressed me. Maybe I'm easy to impress.I could probably go on and on about these, but bottom line: yes they are an overpriced brand name and not the only good product you could get, but if you do decide to buy them you won't be disappointed or feel it's a waste of money. If you want to splurge and treat yourself, these headphones are a safe choice.And hey, if you're filthy rich, what do I care what you do with your money?",12/8/2023,AHSQFTDH4ON7KJQS5YF6JMRUHASQ,1,19,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I do sometimes have some trouble with where they sit on the top of my head after a while if it's in a certain spot, but overall I've been able to wear them for hours at a time cleaning the house or sitting and listening to music and I think they've been great. I wanted them to be able to pair easily with my iphone which they do, and the main purpose I bought them for was to be able to wear them while on walks and still be able to hear my surroundings. The passthrough feature is pretty good, although I did notice that wind noise is a bit loud with 2 of the 3 noise cancellation settings, but not terrible. I also saw people complaining that it was hard to tell which setting you are on, but the sounds are very different for each so if you just quickly memorize which is associated with the appropriate setting, it's really not hard at all to know which one you are on based on the sound. Overall for the price I paid getting them on sale during black, these have been well worth it for what I was looking for",01/18/2024,AHTDAJZX6CASB4TLVNY5PCYJPF5A,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I also had some older Bose wired noise cancelling that worked really well and the AirPod Studio are too expensive, A few month back I read an article comparing the Beats Studio with the AirPod Studios. They both have outstanding features and the report gave the Beats a slight advantage. I saw the Beats Studio on sale a couple of times and was tempted to buy, but talked myself out of it. Then Amazon had their October Prime days sale and on the second day these were at a really really good price. So I bought them with one rule to myself. I couldn't open the box until I sold the Bose on Ebay, which happened pretty quickly, so I ended up paying less than $100 after selling my Bose. I opened the box, put them on a good charge and used them every day for almost 2 weeks before needing a charge. I use them for watching tv and they sound fantastic. They are really good at noise cancellation and Spacial Audio sound better than my AirPod Pros. Love that I can go a looooong time between charges. The AirPod lasted around 4 hours. These can go up to 40. The only complaint is that the padding is not as soft as the Bose and after 3 hours or so, I would have to pull them off and let the top of my ears get a rest from the pressure. The other complaint is that when I'm out walking my dog, there is a very loud buffeting noise on windy days. It's just the shape of the headphones and probably happens on most full size headphones.These use USB-C cables so I plugged them into my Macbook Pro using USB-C and played some lossless music from Apple Music and WOW. I love listening to older music from the 70s and it really has great bass. I've been turning off noise cancelling/transparent mode to get longer life and it has been about 3 weeks of use with only one recharge.One thing is that the carrying case is a bit thicker than the Bose so they might not fit in my favorite carry on bag for my ipod and other gadgets that I can't live without when flying.

They are amazing, and totally surpassed my expectations.The reason I used to only buy ear buds (the kind that have those rubber peices that go deep into your ear) was because I thought that was the only way to get good quality sound and lots of base. I like to dance to fast paced pop music and sweat to the oldies and have my music LOUD. I always assumed ear muff type of headphones would make most of the music/volume escape around the sides. But I was so wrong, these Beats headphones make it sound like you're at the club, or like the music is being performed in the room with you...I heard things in my music that I've never heard before; a subtle drum or base in the background that I didn't know was there, a background singer adding a note at a certain point...And yet it didn't change the song but enhanced it. I didn't know music could sound like this! I'm 32 and kicking myself for not investing in a nice pair of headphones all these years. I dont see how it could get better than this. If you love music, like really love listening to music, you need to have these! Oh, and the 'transparency mode' blew my mind. It actually works and I have no idea how. Charge lasts for weeks (listening to music about an hour or 2 a day). I guess the only downfall is keeping them clean, though I'm sure there's a product out there for that.",01/30/2024,AFQHYSP2HWNWRTFYZ25WP2SFJ3FA,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The ear cups are soft and buttery, and feel nice against the skin. The noise cancelation works really good and it's nice to have the transparent option.

200,R387VQO0IULZOU,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars No more sweaty ears!,Michal,5,"I’m not an audiophile. My AirPods stopped working so I decided I wanted to try on-ear noise canceling headphones with a long battery life. My primary intention is to use them for work calls.I ordered the Bose QC45, very happy with them (I should also mention I was happy with the sound from my basic AirPods before). Except I couldn’t wear them for longer than an hour because my ears would start profusely sweating??? I googled this and turns out it’s a thing! Some people get hot ears from the synthetic material of the ear cups.The main reason I ordered these was because of the leather ear cups. It worked! No more sweaty ears. My ears are bigger than the round part, maybe that’s why, but I still find them very comfortable. Given the “lack of seal” I find the ANC to be fine for my needs.One thing I find annoying is that to put them back in their case, you have to slide the sides back in. They slide smoothly and aren’t notched. So basically, every time I take them out of the case I have to readjust them when I put them on, and since they’re not notched as you slide the sides out I find myself readjusting a few times.The other thing - I was getting frustrated connecting these to my windows work laptop for video calls, but then I remembered there’s an audio jack in the case so now I just use that with no issues. I don’t think they automatically connect to my iPhone like the Bose ones did, but that may be user error. It doesn’t seem like you can easily go between devices like I can with my AirPods from iPhone to MacBook. I didn’t find the app to be intuitive for this either. Hopefully I’ll eventually figure it out.Lastly, I did find that these needed to be broken in - I didn’t know that was a thing, the Bose ones didn’t. Right out of the box, music sounded like it did with my AirPods. I played with the settings, etc. For my needs I didn’t really care, I just wanted my ears to stop sweating. Then one day I was listening to music and the sound was much more impressive.I ordered the sand color, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten black. The case is light grey for these and I’m concerned about staining over time if I’m not super careful. Subjective, but I think black would probably also look more sophisticated on video calls. Overall I’m very happy with these!",10/14/2022,AEHP2RZXKFSJ563FSDU5WFMGK7MA,1,37,Color: SandSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

203,R1TIPXHNTF7XSK,B08YJ3W1HB,4.0 out of 5 stars B&O HX vs Bose NC 700- Bose is the better buy,Cathy White,4,"Recently purchased both the Bang & Olufsen HX headphones and the Bose NC 700 headphones for comparison. My biggest must haves in over the ear headphones are sound quality, call quality and comfort.Call quality The B&O HX’s call quality is not up to par with Bose. While on a phone call walking outdoors wearing the B&O HX’s, the person on the other end of the call said the background noise was deafening and they could not hear me over the noise (city traffic and wind). I switched to the Bose while on the same call and it was worlds better, lowered background noise, and they could hear me much clearer. Bose won this test!Sound QualityThe sound quality of the B&O HX’s was good, however the sound quality depreciates when I switch over to noice canceling. Throughout all modes and different genres of music I noticed the bass is lacking and they focus more on the lyrics and spoken words rather than the music and lyrics. The Bose however blew me out of the water with sound quality, excellent bass, great clarity, and better EQ controls to customize to your liking. Bose wins here as well.ComfortThe B&O HX’s are comfortable headphones with amazing build quality. However the earpiece shape is more round than the Bose and did get uncomfortable after about an hour of use. I also found they struggle to stay planted on my head when I’m moving around quickly (not ideal for running or working out). The Bose however have a silicone lining on the upper arm and stay put on my head when running. Bose also won here!Overall the B&O HX’s are good headphones with excellent features and build quality but at $500 and compared to the Bose NC 700 headphones at $300 I could not justify the higher price tag. I need over the ear headphones to be a device I can use at work to take phone calls and video meetings, at the gym, on an outdoor walk, and on a plane. I feel as though the Bose are the better buy but glad I compared both to find the front runner!",06/17/2023,AFIV6EERHINRWYBMBWFSJBZ5Q3AA,1,40,Color: TimberSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

They're also pretty comfortable, but if you're moving around, say cleaning your house or something, they will fall off your head. Also, great battery life.The bad:1. HORRIBLE Bluetooth handling. Once you pair them to two devices, even if you're nowhere near the second device, upon turning them on, expect a few minutes of glitchy audio getting constantly cut, until it becomes okay. The only remedy to this is to factory reset the headphones and not pair them with more than one device. Again, this happens even nowhere near the second device.2. Iffy touch interface. I still can't reliably skip or pause with the touch interface. Volume is a bit more reliable and has a nice gesture to it.3. Pretty mediocre to sub par NC. Really unimpressive compared to Sony or Bose.In short, I would never buy these knowing what I know now, especially for such a high price.",10/26/2023,AGTD6Q3E7CICZW2AADBOP5VJ2URA,1,14,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

207,R13V05PPNZ72D3,B08YJ3W1HB,1.0 out of 5 stars Terrible Build Quality,Ajd041,1,"I've owned B&O headphones since starting back in 2017 with the h6i, a wired headset that sounded and looked like no other I've ever had since. When the earcups stared to really wear out a couple years later I switched to some H4's, and then an H9i as a surprise Christmas gift.When the H9i's started having battery issues last year I replaced those (fortunately I still kept them to use as wired headphones at my desk) originally with the Beoplay Portal, which had horrible sound quality so I returned them, and I got these instead, the HX. God I wish I never did. They sound much better than the portals but have completely fallen apart on me in a year of normal use in ways none of the other pairs I've owned ever did.I am accustomed to needing to replace Bluetooth headphones every 2-3 years as a matter of course. I have chosen to stay with B&O because their combination of cool aesthetics and good sound (I've kind of weirdly gotten many compliments over the years about having a pair of these around my neck). The HX's sound stage is slightly more muddled in the mids than the H9i, especially when playing in Bluetooth. The controls are less fiddly than the H9i's and the leather felt softer.The build quality, however, is horrible. I'm used to having spots in the leather after daily driving them for years. What I am not used to, is the glue (or whatever) holding the earcups together to totally fall apart and expose the admittedly soft foam to the outside world. They did this just over one year of ownership, meaning I'm out of warranty, and replacement earcups are not available as far as I can tell as they were with previous B&O models.I'm not sure what to do with them at this point. I work from home so I still listen to them in bed from time to time but clearly they're literally falling apart after such a short time. B&O's quality seems to have really fallen off a cliff.

But good.I'm just not having the issues I've read in a few bad reviews here. Everything works fine on mine. Volume control, next play swipe both work fine. The noise canceling is satisfactory to me. I know there are some that may be better in that department. But they are good enough.The other high points about these are that they are very light and comfortable and after hours wearing still no issue hurting my ears or feeling heavy. They completely seal around my ears making for a truly great experience.The very long battery life is a major plus too.I've owned good headphones that only last like 4 or 5 hours and that's a deal breaker for me because I wear them all the time.Now I own numerous pairs of headphones and my Master and Dynamics mw65's are quite good too. Especially if you hook them up through an audio cable and it really increases the sound quality like 10 times better than the Bluetooth function on that pair. That's really the only way I use them. They also are a little heavy and don't make a perfect seal around the ears. But I am curious on how the new mw75's, that Master and Dynamics just came out with, sound like and if they've increased the sound quality in Bluetooth mode.Overall after about 10 hours of break in on these B/O HX's, they sound very well. They do need a break in period.I know that everyone might not agree and are picky beyond belief, but these are worth the money. High quality build and sound. I definitely would buy again.",10/22/2022,AG3E6BMSP3SNWHP7ZHUBU4VLDFWA,1,12,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

The lows are balanced and refined - this is not going to rattle your head, so bass heads stay clear. These headphone really shine for any genre that emphasizes vocals and instruments.

Pulling connection from a third device to a paired one was also quick.3. Build & Comfort. Excellent build, feels premium and great in the hands. My only issue was the ear cups being round and not accommodating the largish ears. Clamp force was just fine as well.4. Features: ANC vs. Normal - barely any difference.

After several hours of practice I still couldn't control it reliably or oftentimes at all.- Sound quality very disappointing. Not awful, just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.Deal-breakers for me on any headphone or earbud are shouty, sibilant treble and fiddly controls. The HXs suffer from fiddly controls. I could swipe forward and back pretty reliably, but volume control was well nigh impossible for me.The sound quality was warm and smooth, but it really lacked any life at all in the top end. I know I'm fussy; first I don't want shouty treble and then I say I want life and liveliness in the top end. Well, I want what I want. For reference, my AirPods Max have life in the top end, which only ever overpowers me on poorly-mixed tracks. Ditto for sibilant consonants.I gave the HXs a go because I wanted a better wired option than my AirPods Max or my Jabra 85h for listening connected to a DAC. The Jabras have a very good sound, but Apple Music Hi-Res lossless and TIDAL MQA expose a thin-sounding weak spot in the male vocal range that gets annoying after a while. I'm looking for something better. I know the Jabras and the HXs are primarily bluetooth headphones, but I wanted something that could be wired for Hi-Res listening without jumping into the deep end of the pool of audiophile wired headphones.I'm returning these for the (essentially) broken volume control design.",02/11/2022,AETXWAJP5XE22OFS2R7N4FYWRW3A,1,6,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I love the brand and own four of their Bluetooth speakers, more importantly for years I enjoyed very much the H9i. Sadly I haven't enjoyed their new line of headphones. I bought a pair of H95 then returned because they are quite uncomfortable, I believe this is primarily because of their excessive weight but excessive clamping force and shape of the ear pads aren't a plus either.Disappointingly not much to be excited about their sound, moreover costing just about the double of everything else out there, to possibly offset the discomfort in wearing this $900 pair of headphones.Too much disappointment for too much money.I really wanted to continue to wear the beautifully built B&O so I ordered the HX. Now I'm back in H9i territory. Very comfortable headphone built with high quality materials and with a stunning look.However while they sound better than my old H9i and have a much improved noise cancellation circuit the HX can't compete with the incredibly refined sound of the cheaper and ultralight weight Sennheiser Momentum 4 nor with their even better noise cancellation feature.I really hated the idea to return the stunning looking HX but the sound of the Momentum 4 is so superior that the far superior aesthetics of the HX was not enough to win me.",09/11/2022,AGYKIFRBRJB2MUFEKZBU35X6V2KA,1,8,Color: TimberSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I've tried many headphones, looking for the ones that play music to my ears. I did return these though due to my ears not fitting completely under the ear pad. No discomfort, even after hours of listening but found it to be troublesome with creating a good seal. Another note, there is circular engraving in the ear cups. There are also earcup commands by swiping on them. The engraving can be quite annoying when trying to skip songs due to your finger naturally wanting to follow the engraving.Still overall great headphones. Can't comment on noise cancelling as it's not really a feature I pay attention to. Isnt the whole point of it to not pay attention?

These new HX that just came in have a lower right speaker than the left, just like the ones from a year ago.It’s barely noticeable, but when you can jump from the H95 to the HX to a set of ribbon tweeter speakers and then to IEMs, it becomes very noticeable that the right speaker is missing bass and vocals.

285,R90RGUEZFLB29,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars Clarity and Space,Alric the Red,5,"If I had to pay for these, Beoplay HX headphones, they would have been, by far, the most expensive headphones I've ever purchased. But I didn't have to pay for them, because I got them by redeeming points on my Visa credit card. But, that said, after experiencing them, I think I'd have paid for them if had known how good they are.I have used headphones for fifty years, off and on, and consistently for the last twenty-five. They are, for me, a necessary component for enjoying music. After years of searching for the ultimate isolated aural experience, I recognized that what I'm after is unattainable: a bass punch that'll rival the same impact you'd get during a live performance; or from grand speakers in your living room. That's simply not possible, because bass during those circumstances is a full-body experience. So the key is to settle for an immersive facsimile. Clarity will then be a key.These headphones are very clear, with sound that seems to come from a distance from the ears. In another review here, the customer said that they had no bass. This does not concur with my own experience, as the bass, to me, stood out, with distinct notes, so that they didn't become lost in a general blurry boom. The same customer also stated that the headphone volume was too low. When I first got these, I had the same problem. The headphones also had a serious issue with connectivity to my devices. After contacting Bang & Olufsen, they recommended a factory reset. This fixed both problems, and I haven't had a problem since, and I've been loving them. At home, I use them exclusively (for the gym, where I might sweat, I use some JBL's I bought for about $80).I recommend them. They're clearly not the most expensive pair of headphones you can buy, but if you're not some tech person or a DJ with very specific demands, these will more than meet your needs._________________________________________",03/22/2023,AH7V5DNF4CKNGQ7EFNFXM7YWSQNQ,0,0,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
286,R2KBC7C12RY9KP,B08YJ3W1HB,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing headphones all around. Jack of all trades, master of... everything.",mbulan,5,"Just wanted to mention that I did not buy these from Amazon, I bought them directly from the B&O online store.I'm going to be truthful because I'm a big fan of B&O. The Beoplay HXs sound, feel, and look very amazing. I don't know really where to start the review.Sound quality: Your typical B&O sound quality. Beautiful, clean, crisp, doesn't sacrifice any instrument, thumping bass but it's not obnoxious or distorts other instruments and/or vocals. Music separation is fantastic. Not like open back or closed-back headphones that are meant to be plugged into an AMP/DAC but it's damn near close. My favorite out-of-the-box sound signature/sound quality brand of headphones where I don't have to tweak the EQ (that much) is B&O, Sennheiser, Monolith, Master & Dynamic, Audeze, and Grado.Battery: B&O claims a 35-hour battery with ANC n and a few more hours with it off. That's incredible and it's true so far. I'm very impressed with the battery.Connection: You can connect through BT or with a wire. Now, this is the one downside to these headphones. When you use the cable, you HAVE to turn the headphones on to hear audio. If I'm wrong, someone please correct me. I'm not going to deduct a star because it doesn't play a huge part to me.- The 5.1 BT connection is solid and doesn't break the connection when my phone is in my pocket or when I'm 2 floors down and left my phone on the third floor.Noise Cancelation: I've owned a pair of H9 3rd Gens and ever since owning those, I've always thought why B&O isn't taken seriously when comparing ANC to say Sony or Bose, the kings.- Let's say ANC is a 10/10 on both Sony and Bose, the HXs are a 9.5/10. Same with the 3rd Gens from what I remember.I'll say it again, I love the HXs. B&O delivers another worthy, beautiful product.

289,R3CWHO44RWT8J3,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars Best all in one package for on the go listening,Claire Chiang,5,"I wouldn’t exactly consider myself an audiophile when I see how hard core some real audiophiles are. I’m not super knowledgeable on the technical side and don’t have a seemingly bottomless budget to spend on owning a wide variety of equipment. However, I do care very much about enjoying my music at the highest level of detail possible.You know the feeling you get when you invest hours into research looking for the optimal product, the product finally arrives in a package at your house, and it really is as great as you were hoping for? That’s the feeling I had the first time I tried on my new Beoplay HX’s. My goal was to find the best sounding headphones to wear out in public, whether it’s for traveling or doing work at a coffee shop or library. And I have finally found the best product for myself. I have owned multiple pairs of headphones from the Bose QC line and the Sony XM line that I used to use for this purpose. But then I spoiled myself by listening to my Sennheiser HD 660S at home too much, and Bose and Sony no longer sounded good enough for me to enjoy my music.Sound quality:Like I was saying, my primary draw to these was that I was looking for the best sound quality possible for a pair of headphones of this class. Technically, the H95 would probably be better if I like these, but they were not on my list of considerations because I was not willing to pay the $850 price tag. In terms of level of enjoyment of music, the HX’s beat all similar noise cancelling headphones I have tried, including all Bose and Sony and other Beoplay headphones. Tight and clear bass which I like, good mids, and enough treble without the fatigue. I have always had a strong dislike for fatiguing treble, because it’s tricky to get the right balance of hearing the treble well but being able to tolerate long listening sessions without the fatigue. These do an excellent job of getting the right balance.Noise cancelling:These are not best in class for noise cancelling, but they fit my standard of “good enough”. And honestly, they’re really not significantly worse than best in class. I did a side by side comparison with my Sony XM3 while playing simulated engine and coffee shop noise from a third device. And while the XM3’s did do better, I could only tell the difference with music off. With music playing, the two pairs felt similar. My standard of “good enough” means that when I’m in a noisy environment, I can enjoy my music with most of the details without needing to blast the volume. At most, I would want the volume to be one notch higher than I would keep it at home in a quiet environment. These definitely get the job done for these intents and purposes.I have also owned the H9 3rd generation and tried the Beoplay Portal, and the HX’s, at least to my ears, beat both by a decent margin. Compared to the H9 3rd, these are better in that the bass is tighter and more refined, and there’s more sparkle or clarity in the mids and treble. I read from multiple sources that the Portals were supposed to have the same drivers as the HX’s, but they don’t sound the same at all. I purchased a pair of Portals to replace my H9’s and was sorely disappointed when I tried them on. My logic was that if HX’s and Portals were really that similar, I might as well have the gaming headset option even if I don’t game that often, but they are definitely not the same in sound. I felt like the Portals were more detailed than the H9 3rd generations, but music just wasn’t enjoyable for reasons I can’t completely articulate because my technical knowledge is limited. It may have to do with the way they were tuned, in that they were designed with less of a focus on being musical and more about hearing your game environment.Comfort:In regards to comfort, the things I look for are that whey I lie down, they don’t slip off my head, ears don’t touch inside of earcup, and that I can wear them for a long period of time without uncomfortable pressure or heat in my ears. These definitely fit the criteria I listed. One of my complaints about the Sony XM series was that they would slip down the back of my head when I wanted to lie down with them due to the weight distribution. The Bose QC series were good about not having that problem. The H9 3rd gen that I owned slipped occasionally. I haven’t had much of a problem with these. Also no problem with my ears touching the inside of the earcups, which was another gripe I had with the Sony XM series.Style/design:If I’m going to be wearing my headphones in public, style or design does matter. And in my opinion, these were designed with looks in mind. In my opinion, better looking than the Sony XM series by far, still better looking than the Bose QC series, and the only competitor comparable in style is probably the Bose 700 (which don’t sound good at all). It is worth noting that these don’t collapse, so they do take up more room in my backpack compared to most competitors. But that’s a relatively small tradeoff I’m willing to make if I love the overall package.",09/5/2021,AH6UE6F2UWY6WJ7VDGA3OL44LNEA,0,6,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

297,R1KICATQR8R082,B08YJ3W1HB,2.0 out of 5 stars SOMETHING TO BE CONCERNED BEFORE YOU MAKE THE PURCHASE,gimbal,2,"I’ve been a Bang & Olufsen loyalist for years. I own a number of their audio products. The issue I’m having is with their new H9 replacement, Beoplay HX. The touch control is non-responsive to volume control. I’ve owned every generation of the H9 line, RMA’d an H9 3rd Gen previous to the HX, with a defective Bluetooth module.I bought the Beoplay HX days after its release. The unit arrived 5 days from the date of purchase. I was rather disappointed it arrived defective, especially after a previous RMA on an H9 3rd Gen. barely 2 months ago. Also, the noise cancellation doesn't even match the H9, there's leakage into the headphones from the surroundings, or the technology has been degraded in this model. At this rate, quality control is rather concerning compared to previous models. I want to purchase the E8 3rd Gen Sport for the gym but I have decided to hold off, or maybe go with something like Sennheiser or Bose.To put my hardware engineering hat on, in my opinion, the circular swipe design lends itself to problems because of the large capacitive touch area. They call it intuitive but it just doesn’t work as reasonably expected. It’s not flawless like Bose’s even on a good unit. This is my biggest knock on most modern B&O headphones with this volume control mechanism. I’m not sure why B&O insists on these awkward mechanics. I believe Bose is fairly successful in this area because their capacitive swipe is quite smooth and fairly accurate (I’ve owned all models of Bose headphones as well). On the Bose NC 700, to increase the volume, hold and swipe up. To decrease the volume, hold and swipe down. This in my opinion is more intuitive.The HX was the first purchase from the B&O website, I’ve made other purchases on Amazon and their boutique stores around the world. Obtaining an RMA on the online purchase was not an issue, it was a fairly easy process. I take issue with the non-sensical return process. After shelling $500 for a pair of headphones that arrived defective to no fault of mine, I don’t want to wait for another 40 to 50 days to get my hands on another pair. The 30 days free return on the website is misleading at best. It’s really lacking in details to account for this long return process. You don’t get a refund for another 2 to 3 weeks after they receive the defective unit. No matter if it’s the 30 days free return advertised on their website or return for replacement, the return shipping label from the company, in either case, is UPS ground, which could take up to a week to reach their warehouse. Adding to the 2 to 3 weeks RMA return process I mentioned, when all said and done, expect the return and refund process to take a month before you see your money. If you plan to re-purchase another unit, adds another 4 days to 5 days to received the unit. Expect 5 weeks to enjoy your Beoplay HX if you receive a defective unit. I can successfully RMA a Bose product and have my money back in less than a week. The big question becomes, why wait this long if returns are free as advertised? Logic dictates one should get a refund when they receive the unit and verify contents, a process that shouldn’t take more than 48 hours to be charitable. In my opinion, they should add the language “Allow 4 to 6 weeks for free return or RMA,” to be accurate.Alternatively, you can fork more cash to purchase another unit with the hope you will get a refund on the defective unit; that’s a $1,000 opportunity cost to you and cash-at-hand for B&O. If this sounds like a Ponzi scheme, that is my concern. And the story doesn’t end there. The surprise came when I tried to air my concerns to a supervisor or manager. They don’t exist… Similar to the Chinese model of customer service, the support staff you speak to on the phone is the end of the line. They don’t even have anyone to call you back. Per the support team call line, supervisors or managers don’t exist. If support can’t address your issue, you’re SOL!… If I’m purchasing a premium pair of headphones, I expect commensurate customer service. Companies selling $50 headphones have supervisors who can address concerns beyond the support staff level. This is the reason I referred to this manner of doing business as akin to a Ponzi Scheme—everything about the B&O decision-making chain is opaque. This business model appears to be ""TRUST US"", like the majority of Chinese manufacturers. Trust comes with transparency. If you don’t have a front-facing supervisory staff and want to sell consumers, then this is a major problem. Most consumers like to know concerns are being addressed by management should the need arise to escalate an issue. B&O generally makes good products but my online experience has been an eye-opener. In my opinion, they need to be more responsive to customers' concerns, especially if one is to spend a premium on their headphones. I’m not sure they appreciate there is a healthy level of competition with many reputable electronic makers coming on board to get a piece of this rapidly growing pie.From my experience, Bose is a level above the rest when it comes to their RMA process. Even though the return is ground, your exchange is ready to go as soon as UPS scans the return. You can receive an exchange for a defective unit in as little as 3 days from the time you request an RMA. Depending on how fast you need your headphones, shipping on the replacement unit can be upgraded as a courtesy to UPS 2nd Day Air. Compare that with 5 to 6 weeks for B&O. Plus, you can escalate your concerns to the level you wish, they are available to address your concerns. If they make a mistake with their order process, you get a free upgrade or sometimes free headphones. Bose has the best customer service experience in my book when it comes to consumer headphones. That’s what I expect from a premium headphone maker.UPDATE: 4-22-21 - Thoughts After Purchasing the 2nd Headset in Lieu of Waiting For RMA Process to Complete:I went with my option B and bought another pair of headphones while waiting for the previous set to get RMA'd for a full refund hopefully. The problem I stated, with my first headsets--non-responsive volume control swipe--still persists. In my opinion, this is most likely a hardware flaw or a bad production batch. You can't have two different headsets bought at different time periods exhibiting the exact same problem. I'm comparing it to the smooth mechanics of the Beoplay H9 series. I found however that if you press on the control area with a moderate-to-high amount of pressure, it works somewhat, but is far from accurate, or even an ideal solution. This is something Bang & Olufsen engineers may have to address. I'm not sure if this can be done through a firmware update. If it's adjusting sensitivity, this can be done... I like the headphones, the earcups are slighting larger, the sound signature is what you expect from B&O, and the carrying case is finally commensurate with premium headphones. But I'm disappointed with the ANC. It is not as good as the H9, which was not as effective as say Bose NC 700. I will keep them for the 30-day grace period and see if I can live with this big inconvenience if no proposed hardware remedies. If anything changes, I will be sure to provide an update.UPDATE: 4-24-21: Battery LifeWOW!!!... The battery life on these headphones is truly amazing, I just had to share this update.I decided to put together my Summer tracks. I couldn't believe the battery life on these headphones. They last over 48 hours of continuous heavy music listening, with ANC on, at about 80% volume, and still had 20% battery remaining!! I haven't experienced any premium headphones out there with such juice. You have to move into custom $1,000 plus headphones. Battery life is truly phenomenal, better than advertised in this experience!! Bose NC 700 are ready to quit after less than 24 hours of continuous listening with ANC on. Sony MX1000's go a little longer but nothing compared to the B&O HXs. This is a big positive if you travel frequently.",04/20/2021,AGZ6OFEP6AH4EN2L4OKSFNTAVCEA,0,34,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
298,R1BH8ZWT0J9FU,B08YJ3W1HB,"5.0 out of 5 stars Premium design, beautiful sounding, comfortable, decent but not spectacular noise cancellation",Mahajo,5,"I’ve been wanting to try Bang & Olufsen headphones for sometime but the H95’s were just too much $$$ for me to justify the expense. However the newer HX’s were a $100 off their regular price so I decided now was the time to try them. I have tried numerous wireless noise canceling headphones over the last year and really liked a number of them but none were exactly right for one reason or another. I tried Sennheiser Momentum 3’s, Bowers & Wilkins PX7’s, Master and Dynamics MW65’s, Shure Aionic 50’s and still own the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and the AirPods Max. In my opinion the Bang & Olufsen HX’s are the best of the lot, overall, but aren’t perfect by any means but are very close. Longer battery life, excellent sound especially when tweaked with the equalizer in the Bang & Olufsen app and are super comfortable for extended wear. Noise cancelling is very good, not Sony level but close. To my ears sound better than the AirPods Max and so much lighter and more comfortable. One note on comfort is yes, the round ear cups are smaller then the rectanglular shape of the AirPods Max and will probably sit a little on your ears as they do mine, however the leather covered memory foam ear pads combined with the light but stable clamping force of these headphones make it a non issue. After 3+ hours of wear I was only minimally aware of them, they are that comfortable. They have a wear detection feature but I found even on the reduced setting it would pause music with the slightest turn of my head so I turned it off. I read longer hair (I do need a hair cut) can cause issues and a recalibration can fix it but it’s not that important to me at this time. As for the only other issue that will bother some is the touch controls are finicky for sure, the play, pause and swipe to change tracks works fine but the volume swipe around the cup is very difficult to get to work, at least for me it has been, but still not that big of a deal to me. I love the sand color with the gold accented aluminum finish on the cups which is eye-catching for sure. Only had them for less than 24 hours so can’t really speak about battery life as of yet but seems to be on par with what Bang & Olufsen claim. Sound quality is top-notch with a well balanced sound the you can adjust in the app to what you like. Bass is precise and pleasant, especially on the warmer side of the eq but not overpowering like some. It hits the sweet spot for me. Over-all these are my favorite headphones yet and I highly recommend them especially at the Black Friday prices! I may update later as I use them more and after I use them outside of the apartment. I’m a headphone addict I guess and I love these headphones!11/28/21 Update. The wear sensors work great as long as you calibrate them first: have the headphones on a flat surface, turn them on, turn in the wear sensors and then put them on. Once calibrated they work perfectly. I do recommend the “reduced sensitivity “ setting. Also the volume slider works fine as long as you are swiping in the right spot inside the ring on the right ear cup. Battery life is as advertised! Love them!Update 12/16/21: Sadly, I decided to return these headphones for a couple of reasons: noise cancelling was not very strong and didn’t really block out much noise (especially on the bus commuting to work). The wear sensors worked when calibrated every time you turn on the headphones but when I had them connected to both my iPhone and iPad Pro they would always auto play music from my iPad no matter what I had been listening to prior to turning them on/off. Also the sound was very finicky, they sounded great for instrumental and jazz but other genres weren’t as great with either sharp highs or the bass would distort at higher volumes (even after the software update was supposed to fix this issue). I was constantly having to adjust the EQ to find a good sound that wouldn’t sound great across all songs. I really wanted to love them because of the premium design, materials and good looks, but in the end decided they weren’t worth the high price. Went back to the Sony WH-1000XM4’s and am happy with my decision (strong sound and excellent noise cancellation).Update Again, 2/16/22. After purchasing and liking Shure’s Aonic 40 headphones, but not satisfied with their build quality, I couldn’t resist purchasing the B & O Beoplay HX (this time in Black Anthracite) again and I’m so happy I did. (What was I thinking returning them?) the build quality is first rate, super comfortable (despite the round ear cups which do sit on my ears a bit, but are soft and really comfortable even for long periods) and the sound quality is the best over all that I’ve tested. I wasn’t impressed the first time with the noise cancellation but upon this second listen realize it is better than I gave it credit for and slightly better than than the noise cancellation on the Shure’s. Once you find the right spot on the unusual eq in the app the sound is kind of unparalleled. The only issues I have found is the wear sensors don’t always work so I turned them off, and the multi-point connection causes some unwanted functions like automatically playing from my iPad Pro even if I was listening on my iPhone last time they were connected. (Auto play not an issue with the sensors turned off anyway). Also, the touch controls are finicky but I’ve found most are. Not deal breakers for me. I revised my rating and now highly recommend the HX, particularly at a discounted price (they are pricey, but you get what you pay for, as they say!)",11/25/2021,AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,1,33,Color: SandSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
299,RAMQPMSIOUZMD,B08YJ3W1HB,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the cost if you have the $$$,T.Hoff,5,"I bought these knowing I could return them as I was wary of the price. I have a lot of headphones Sony XM3s, Sennheishre HD600s, Bose QC30s, Senn MTW, etc. I have to say these are excellent. Comfort is exemplary - you truly do forget you have them on. Sound is superb. Better than Sony's significantly. Sony's can sound muddy. Connectivity is finicky at first and almost a deal breaker. I updated them and also used them for a few days and somehow it sorted itself out. They always repair with my phone and laptop with a rare issue. Controls are ok - take some getting used to but work (mostly). NC is just ok. I didn't buy these for NC, but can say for sure not as good as Sony's or Bose - but that is expected. Overall, build quality, sound quality and comfort make these a good purchase imo.",09/10/2021,AF353W6MYBQEMKSHYYDBNKQWNBJA,1,10,Color: Black AnthraciteSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
300,RAI90QWJQJF03,B07YVYZ8T5,5.0 out of 5 stars Literally mind-blowing upgrading from AirPods Pro 2,Christian Waymire,5,"Beats**all coming from an airpods & airpods pro 2 user**Two notes about me:* I have a pretty average sized head & ears* I wear glassesThoughts:- Noise isolation is way better than people give credit for, works about as well as the active noise cancellation on my airpods pro 2.- I can FEEL the bass.- Can hear all kinds of details in music (like when I upgraded to airpods pro but slightly better than even those). The AirPods gen 2 did that for me, then the AirPods Pro 2 did it again, and now these are doing the same.- Electronic music sounds absolutely amazing. Better than any other headphones or speaker I’ve heard.- Classical sounds amazing—way better than AirPods Pro 2.- Folk sounds amazing, & it’s like someone’s playing a really high end guitar right next to me while also serenading me.- Piano also sounds especially amazing- Case is slightly padded, but leaves a lot to be desired there—they also barely fit (see pictures).- They feel durable, even at hinges (which shocked me).- They DO fingerprint easily, if that matters to you.- Box is very sleek & giftable.- Not having the automatic ear detection is really nice for when I lift one side up to hear someone or something.- They are more comfortable than AirPods Pro, even with memory foam ear tips on those. But they do get slightly annoying with glasses but there is a sweet spot where it’s not bad (if I angle the headband towards the back of my head instead of having it straight up and down). But it’s not so uncomfortable that I don’t want to use them. Merely a minor inconvenience.- I ever so slightly wish I could see the battery percentage on my phone while charging, but it’s not any real inconvenience.- The micro-USB charger is potentially going to be a slight inconvenience because they wear out—USB-C or a lightening cord would’ve been way better.- Pairing with an iPhone is extremely easy.- The included carabiner for the case is a nice afterthought, but it’s a super flimsy carabiner and the loop keeping it on the case is tiny and I wouldn’t trust it. If it were better sewn and had a bigger loop, that’d be fantastic. I CAN attach an aluminum locking carabiner, but it’s just barely big enough for that.- Charging seems pretty fast, and while I do wish it would show me the percentage while charging, I really appreciate seeing the percentage in the battery widget while connected because other non-apple Bluetooth headphones don’t have that and I’m left guessing how much is left on the tiny control center icon with those.In sum, I HIGHLY recommend these if you’re looking for good bluetooth headphones and don’t have $400+ to spend. I snagged them for $99.95, and I couldn’t be happier. They’re definitely a good value at $200, but they’re mind blowing at a part-time, minimum wage budget. Almost every feature has been either mind blowingly fantastic, but those that aren’t are barely worth commenting on.Are they perfect? No. Should one expect perfection at this price? Absolutely not. I’d highly recommend buying if they’re in your budget!!!",10/17/2023,AH6FFZWTYTQH3JFZKOI4VDFSDWRA,1,439,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

Great headset for college students. However the only downside is they aren’t super comfortable to lay down in or sleep with, but still fit amazing, have great sound quality, auto connect to my devices with no issues. And also are very durable, I’ve dropped them multiple times and have had no issues after about 6 months of having them. 10/10 headset",05/18/2024,AFIJUR2VSHB22IMJLMDTASXNVQOQ,1,2,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
302,R2IQV1A1SCQDVZ,B07YVYZ8T5,5.0 out of 5 stars These headphones deserve the hype!,Mariah Chapman,5,"At last I finally found the perfect wireless headphones!! I bought these back in November when they were on sale for Black Friday (only $80!) and wanted to give them a test period before I reviewed them. Here’s what I’ve experienced this far:Pros1. The sound quality is impeccable. Literally everything is so clear and crisp. Funny enough, to put it into perspective, I was watching a movie and did not notice faint background music until I put these headphones on.2. The battery life is great. For me, they last roughly 72 hours before I need to fully recharge them. With charging, it takes maybe 40 minutes to an hour to get back up to a full charge. Impressive3. They’re compact and foldable. You’d be surprised how many headsets don’t fold when you’re done using them but these are perfect if you need to travel.4. They can connect to anything! I connected them to the Bluetooth on my tv for the first time since I didn’t want to wake my roommate up at 2am and set up was easy and simple.5. Changing the volume or song is simple and easy.6. Not really a pro, just an opinion, but they are really cute and stylish.Cons:1. A lot of people were right about them hurting your ears after having them on for too long; maybe more than 4 hours of continuous wear. I wish the part that goes around your ears was a little bigger to minimize the discomfort, but nonetheless it’s not a huge deal.2. Don’t connect them to numerous things at once. For instance, I had these paired with my iPhone and laptop at the same time. When I turned on my laptop it disconnected from my iPhone automatically and vice versa. My suggestion, disconnect from the device you’re not using and only focus on one sole device at a time.3. I wish the charger came with a charging block instead of just a wire. If you don’t have an extra block make sure you get one.4. They are not 100% noise cancelling but it does block out a good amount of outside noise5. My only concern is that when you call someone or someone calls you there’s a weird echo in the background. Like every time you talk it sounds like you’re talking in a tunnel? Again not a big deal just something I’ve noticed.Overall, I’m really happy with this purchase and if you’re considering getting these just do it. I really needed them for studying purposes and they get the job done 100%.",01/19/2024,AHKIWC4UYPVHMRXYTTGAEA655Q2Q,1,139,Color: SilverStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

305,R1T7HWPFEWQG4F,B07YVYZ8T5,4.0 out of 5 stars Immersive Sound and Stylish Design: A Review of Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones,CMReviewer,4,"The Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a fantastic choice for anyone seeking high-quality sound and convenient wireless connectivity. From their sleek design to their impressive battery life, these headphones have quickly become a favorite accessory in my daily life.One of the standout features of the Beats Solo3 headphones is their immersive sound quality. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks, the audio is crisp, clear, and full-bodied, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the listening experience.The wireless connectivity is another major selling point for these headphones. Thanks to the Apple W1 headphone chip and Class 1 Bluetooth technology, pairing the headphones with my devices is seamless and hassle-free. Plus, with up to 40 hours of listening time on a single charge, I never have to worry about running out of battery during long commutes or flights.However, it's important to note that the ear covers on the Beats Solo3 headphones may not fully cover the ears, which can cause discomfort for those with sensitive ears. As someone who prefers over-ear headphones for this reason, I did notice some discomfort after extended periods of use.Overall, despite this minor issue, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are an excellent choice for anyone in search of stylish, high-quality headphones with impressive sound and wireless convenience.

306,R1SLLOFV53BSY,B07YVYZ8T5,5.0 out of 5 stars Love these.,Bart,5,"I got my first pair in 2016 for free from Apple when I bought a computer with my student discount. I used them every day until sometime in 2023 when the overhead band snapped. So I bought these to replace them.I have a very small head and stretched earlobes. Most over ear head phones are way too big and fall off if I look down. Or they sit in a way that makes my plugs dig into the pressure point behind the ear lobe. These head phones do neither. They fit snug without hurting my hears, these are on ear not over the ear. They do start to ache if I wear them for several hours with my glasses on though, like if I’m on a flight for a long time. But I think that happens with most headphones.They have great base and are great for noise cancelling. They fully charge in about on hour. Maybe less.Definitely recommend if you’ve got a small head and shuffle to find headphones that stay on. If you’re a giant man with a giant head, don’t get these. They’ll be too small.",05/27/2024,AFM3O6PY6AYDORNPO4BIMBHD4TYQ,1,0,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

I'm sure there are products with better sound quality and noise canceling but for the low price and insane battery life they're definitely better than most other products ive seen.They're comfortable and easily adjusted, my only complaint is that they're fairly tight so it can hurt your ears after a few hours but that's bound to happen with any headphones.Overall great product, I've used them every day since I bought them and never once regretted my purchase.",06/8/2024,AF6CZPUOUWRIFXF4VB3VFLZGYCDA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
309,R1NPJGY6ZELSU,B07YVYZ8T5,"4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running, ear pads a bit small",M,4,"I run outdoors frequently and was looking for a decent pair of headphones because my area is noisy and I was tired of constantly adjusting my airpods while running. I wanted something with serviceable audio quality that I also wouldn't mind putting through the constant wear and tear of sweaty runs. I was previously wearing a more expensive pair of headphones to run, and while I do prefer those for use at home or for noise-canceling, they were too heavy and hot for running and I was worried about damaging them. The beats solo3 are a better fit for this particular use case (for me).Pros:- the apple bluetooth chip is extremely useful, it makes it so much more convenient to switch between devices! Major QOL improvement over other headphones I own- lightweight and don't make my ears hot during exercise- stay put well even with a lot of movement (I've even worn these while hanging upside down at the gym and they didn't fall off)- blocks out the perfect amount of sound for outdoor running, such that I'm not distracted by ambient noise but I still have enough situational awareness to hear a car honking at me at close range- audio quality is better than any of my in-ear headphones, which is really all I needed in this case- battery life is great, I never find myself running out of battery even though I use these quite a bitCons:- My primary reason for deducting a star: I was expecting these to be over-ear, but they're actually more like on-ear; the ear pads are a bit tight and sometimes they start to hurt my ears after wearing them for longer periods of time, usually after ~45 minutes (I'd be especially cautious if you have any cartilage piercings)- It's a bit hard to use the control buttons sometimes- the double tap to skip is a little finicky, sometimes if I press too quickly in succession or not hard enough it doesn't register. The volume controls are so much smaller and so far to the top and bottom, respectively, that I sometimes accidentally hit the center pause button instead. Still convenient to have controls there, but they have room for improvement. I also find myself wishing that I could use the controls from either side instead of just the one, but that's not a big deal.- I worry that the band might be damaging my hair a bit, as it's a pretty grippy material. It's not pulling out any hair, but I do wish it had a bit more slip since the headphones feel tight enough to stay put regardless",02/25/2024,AHMFDYUZPJZD6H4D22HIWLJNTG4A,1,14,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

331,R2P3JRB3XRYY3I,B07YVYZ8T5,4.0 out of 5 stars the best headphones,Angel,4,"The best headphones. I was looking for the perfect headphones with the qualities of sound cancellation , durability, color and comfortability and I found the perfect ones. How i even found out about this product is because one day i was working out at the gym with my cousin and i need music loud enough and my airpods was not loud enough for me so me and my cousin swapped and i was so satisfied with the loudness of it and i was so focused and encouraged to finish my workout. I really like these because of the sound cancellation mostly , when I am doing my school work working out and I don't want to hear anything I put these on and everything on the outside just goes mute and the headphones just do their job. In a lot of headphones I feel like the advertisement is really fake. As someone who has tried the majority of wireless headphones this one is probably one of my favorites so far. But I do have some dislikes and likes about this product starting off with the dislikes . first thing i would like to start of with is how big the headphones are like there so noticeable and there just there i wish there were smaller nad like airpods sort of another dislike is u could hear the music out the headphones loud and clear so it's like whatever your listing to others can hear which i honestly hate that. Next is that you can lay down with them like if u were laying down on your ear its just super uncomfortable because like i said on how big it is. Now let's move on to the like starting off with the ear muffs they put on the headphone . The earmuffs are what makes this product super comfortable and if it's cold your ears will be warm because of the earmuffs. Next is the loudness of course like i said in the beginning and the sound cancellation. Finally, I love how this product has multiple colors and they are all beautiful but the color I have is just out of this world which is the pink rose gold color love love love this color is just such a pretty color and it's my type of vibe. My honest review for the headphone is 4.8/5 these are great headphones and they have everything you need in them i just personally don't like hoe big and bulky they are and how you can hear the music outside the headphones but other than that love this product and i highly recommend you buy this for a friend or family member or even yourself if your looking for a headphone with noise cancellation and loudness to it .",11/28/2023,AEOW7ZE5YPXQQLYVVXAFJ5WKTXLA,1,15,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

333,RUB5O4PEU2112,B07YVYZ8T5,5.0 out of 5 stars not bad for the price,amy w,5,"I’ve used Beats for some time- but not the headphones. The earbuds have been such a good investment for me so I figured I’d give the headphones a try. Purchased when it was on sale which I can’t complain about. The sound quality is pretty good, but the noise cancellation isn’t as good as the earbuds I’ve experienced. I work in an office where everyone is on a call and talking, so noise canceling is something I look for in a pair of headphones. It more so muffles the external noises but that’s all. The fit is snug which is good for working out, and the adjustability is easy to figure out. The colors are a nice touch to the appearance, but the best part is the charging aspect. One charge is good for a week of consistent use. Plus it doesn’t take long to charge either, which is great for anyone in a rush",04/16/2024,AEDGAFMHRDTDFKBHU5HFYTSNJRLA,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

351,RWAWWHNPITXJD,B07YVYZ8T5,4.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Style and Performance,Eric W.,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, they have left a lasting impression on me. From their sleek design to impressive sound quality and long-lasting battery life, these headphones have become my constant companion for both daily commutes and intense workout sessions.First and foremost, the design of the Beats Solo3 headphones is striking. The sleek and streamlined appearance, combined with the iconic Beats logo, exudes a sense of modernity and style. The headphones come in a variety of attractive colors, allowing users to express their personality and preferences. The on-ear design is comfortable and snug, providing a secure fit that stays in place even during vigorous activities.The sound quality is undeniably excellent. The Beats Solo3 headphones deliver a powerful and bass-heavy sound signature that suits various music genres. The bass response is deep without overpowering the vocals and trebles, resulting in an immersive audio experience. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks, watching movies, or playing games, the headphones never fail to impress with their rich and dynamic sound.The wireless connectivity is a game-changer. Pairing the Beats Solo3 with my devices is effortless, thanks to the Apple W1 chip. The Bluetooth connection remains stable and reliable, allowing me to move around without any dropouts. Additionally, the on-ear controls are intuitive and easy to use, enabling me to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with a simple tap.The battery life of the Beats Solo3 headphones is outstanding. With up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge, I rarely have to worry about running out of power during extended use. Moreover, the Fast Fuel feature is incredibly handy, providing three hours of playback after just a 5-minute charge, perfect for those last-minute situations.The headphones also feature a built-in microphone, which works well for making calls and using voice assistants like Siri. However, the microphone's performance in noisy environments could be improved, as it tends to pick up background noise.Comfort-wise, the on-ear design may not be suitable for everyone, especially during prolonged wear. Some users might experience slight discomfort or ear fatigue after extended use, but this can be alleviated by adjusting the fit and taking short breaks.While the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones deliver impressive sound quality and wireless convenience, the premium price tag might be a deterrent for some budget-conscious consumers. However, the product's performance and brand reputation are likely to justify the investment for audiophiles and fans of the Beats brand.In conclusion, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a stylish and reliable choice for music enthusiasts seeking powerful sound and seamless wireless functionality. With a few minor improvements in comfort and microphone performance, these headphones could easily score a perfect rating. If you prioritize style, sound quality, and long-lasting battery life, the Beats Solo3 headphones won't disappoint.",07/24/2023,AH6BBFPUMBAE5YUGOFBLLM7KBGLQ,1,86,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

They hurt my ears if they’re on for a long period of time but that’s usually how it goes for headphones. I will say that one small complaint I have is that my hair keeps getting pulled out due to strands getting stuck in the opening on the sides so it results in me having to carefully pull them out or they’ll get pulled. Another small complaint is that people can hear the music you’re listening to if you have it on high volume, but I tend to listen to music on high volume so that could be a me issue. Other than that I’m satisfied with the headphones and the sound quality and price is very agreeable :)",03/2/2024,AHSBGKKIP4UDGIBF7Y7ROTSVKWBQ,1,2,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

375,R2RAY6TSYGNK51,B07YVYZ8T5,5.0 out of 5 stars Best of 3 in comparison,Paul Ratzlaff,5,"I bought these flash sale for $41 versus the list price of 59.99 and compared it to the Raycon every day headphones which listed for 99.99 and I got through Black Friday sale for 69.99 and found the Raycons Had a better feel. The Life Q 20s had to be played with full volume on the phone did not connect automatically to Bluetooth like the Raycon did and they were not water resistant like the Raycons were. The Raycons had a more in-depth base about it and I liked the way the Raycons Told you that it was connected to the Bluetooth when you first put them over your ears. I could feel the sound better with the Raycons. The soundcore, Life Q 20s did not connect automatically and just gave you a series of bleeps to let you know it was connected. So construction wise and convenience wise and sound wise I found the Raycons better. I then compared the Raycons to a pair of beats solo3 which listed for 199 and you can get them at Costco in black for $99 which is what I paid for them in an Amazon cyber Monday sale. The sound quality of the beats solo3 was by comparison Superior to even the Raycons. If you set your phone volume to high, you can still adjust the beats up or down without it affecting the volume on your phone, whereas both the Raycon and the soundcore when you increase or decrease the volume it would increase or decrease it on your phone . I returned this product and spent the little extra money for the beats solo3 and am happy. But if you’re looking for a good sound for under 50 bucks the soundcore life Q20 is very good. For a price between 50 and 100 the Raycon fit the category and was great, and if you’re not afraid to spend the extra bucks, the beats solo3 is the best.",11/27/2023,AFDUE4P2K26EO2ZHXFVG4TUTJRGQ,1,14,Color: SilverStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

383,R18SYH8M0MNZTT,B07YVYZ8T5,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones but some cons.,Amazon Customer,4,"These beats are really great and the adjustable thing on the top really lets them fit nice on your head. And the sound quality is actually amazing. On top of that, beats and apple have some sort of connected/deal (idrk) and because of this, when you turn them on, they automatically pair directly to your iPhone (I have a 14) and don’t make you go thru any annoying pairing process every time. They also directly show the beats icon, connection, and battery life directly on your iPhone. You also get a free month trial of Apple music plus. My only issue is that the ear part that surrounds your ear is rather small, so this may be an issue, and it is for me. After a while, my ears kinda begin to feel annoyed or hurt because it is not encompassing my full ear, so I feel that either the price of them, they could maybe have made them a little bigger. And the travel case is also pretty small and tight. I am pretty sure beats has a more expensive and different option that does fully surround your ear but it’s pretty pricey.

400,R1ZIS9GF8Z8EGP,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet the world without sacrificing the Music’s quality! Amazing sound, features & Alexa enabled!",A. Clark Fine Art,5,"The noise cancellation is exceptional on these headphones. With 10 levels I can block out most of what is going on around me, when it is safe to do so. If you are someone that startles easily, like myself, you will probably get scared a lot because you will not hear what or who is walking up behind you. My husband finds this very humorous.The sound quality was every bit of what I expected from Bose. Crisp, rich audio, with an amazing range of clarity, from your treble to mid tones and excellent bass. It’s easy to slip into your own little oasis with these on.They are also quite comfortable, their padded band and ear cups are soft and do not apple much pressure against your head. They are very light weight and I can wear them for hours without issue.The included case is well made, sturdy and not overly bulky allowing my to pack it and take it with me anywhere. It has a storage compartment for your cables so you always know where they are.The battery life is excellent! I can go days without charging, but if I do need to charge, they replenish quite quickly and I am right back in business. I have easily gotten a full 20 hour charge out of these. I like that when you turn them on they immediately tell you how many hours they have left on their current charge and what devices they are connected to. This makes it easy to check how long you can use them on their current charge, before you head out somewhere where you might not have access to a plug. I found the time they tell me I have left on my charge to be quite accurate. I am able to connect to more than one device (like my iPhone and iPad) and they intuitively play the sound from the device I am using at the moment. I love that feature it’s easy to switch from watching something on my iPad to listening to music from my phone. Bose also includes a cable so you can plug directly to your device and go wired. I have not used this feature because the battery life is so long, I have not run into a situation where it was necessary.The buttons and touch features of these headphones are wonderful. I can turn Alexa (Siri or Google) on or off depending on my needs. I can control the volume sliding my finger up or down on the surface of one ear and can tap to pause and swipe to change songs. With one button I can rotate between 3 levels of noise cancellation that I can set within my app. I have not had the chance to utilize some of the AR on these yet but cannot wait to try it on our next vacation, it will be like bringing along our own tour guide.I love that Alexa is built in. I’m an artist and when I’m painting in my studio it is very nice to be able to use Alexa to change my music without needing to touch my device or my headphones.I saved and waited to get these after trying them and comparing to the Sony competitive model and I am so glad I did. I found the bass of the Sony WH1000 series to be a little scratchy sounding and the overall sound just wasn’t as crisp as the Bose 700 series. I had a pair of Cowin E-7s and those, while they were great at their price point and did the job while I was saving up for these, they just weren’t even in the same class as the Bose 700. These, in my opinion (and I spent a lot of time putting headphones on and off, listening to how everything sounded on each), set the bar and everything else is just trying to measure up. Only the Sony WH1000 series could come close, but for me their sound quality still fell short. The only way to describe it was, you knew you were listening to a recording, whereas the sound from the Bose 700, you could close your eyes and it sounded like you were listening to it actually being played by the artist live the sound is just that crisp and clear no echo or scratch it’s clear vibrant and rich, everything I expected from Bose.I am very happy with my purchase, they were worth the wait and I would certainly recommend them to everyone!One Note I have very sensitive sinuses and when I put on noise canceling headphones, I can actually feel a pressure in my ears and sinus cavities, this does happen with the Bose as well (it happens with every brand I have tried if the cancellation is of any really quality). That said it does not deter me, nor do I feel it’s would be a reason I wouldn’t recommend them or give them a lower star rating. I can feel it when I activate the noise cancellation at its max level but everyone else I have asked to try them, can’t. So chances are very likely this will not be something that the average person even realizes. I can still use the noise cancellation and can block out enough that I never hear my husband walk into my studio until he taps me on the shoulder and scared the heck out of me. I only include this info in case there are others out there that also experience this, with the Bose 700 you can control the levels and it’s easy to step your way up through 10 levels of cancellation and find one that blocks the noise out, while still being comfortable to your sinuses. That is why I would recommend to everyone! Other headphones are cancellation on or off and if you are sensitive to it that can render the feature useless. Again not the case with the Bose 700 series. I use this feature all the time, have found the level that is perfect for me and the noise cancellation is amazing. It is so nice to finally be able to use this feature.I will also add that unlike other headphones the noise cancellation does not affect the quality of the sound I am listening to either! I have tried many where the sound completely changes the moment you turn it on, not with these. The sound remains crisp and rich and clear as it did without the noise cancellation. The only difference is the world around you gets quieter and the music sounds amazing! If you read this whole review Thank You if you are considering these headphones and trying to compare, in my opinion there is no comparison and I don’t think you will be disappointed choosing the Bose 700 series. I hope this info helped.",02/6/2020,AGR7CSKHU5EJ7UXLHEE7NABIXTYQ,1,362,Color: Black
401,R15CPIQJP7FJYE,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars O.M.G.,Robby Bershow,5,"Bottom Line Up Front: These are great, fantastic, awesome, and a bunch of other words. The sound is fantastic, the ANC blocks out almost everything (in a normal and some not so normal environments), the mics do a fantastic job picking out only my voice on calls, the battery life is good, range is great, and (biggest surprise of all) the app works!Rest of the Story: I rushed to find a new headset after coming home and finding my JBLs lying on the floor in a state of repose that let me know that my toddler had done his worst. No amount of resuscitation worked; they were gone. Quickly cycling through the stages of grief, I set off to find a new respite from the constant cacophony that accompanies the child since I needed to have a sanctuary of calm and also a way to join calls without people informing me constantly about background noise.Read a bunch of reviews and guides; many people seem to have very particular tastes surrounding their very detailed preferences in sound quality, how the headphones look (because apparently one can improve their appearance wearing over-ear headphones), and any number of non-sensical comparisons. Here's my key features that I imagine are the most important to an average human just looking for a tool to get the job done:1. ANC works well within reasonable expectations of what is possible at a price point less than a used car2. Mic filters out unwanted noise while picking up my/your voice well3. Good battery life so it doesn't have to be ritually charged every day4. Connections to devices are easy and consistent5. Comfortable to wear for long periods6. Doesn't break the bank and, preferably, is a value7. Durable (see toddler comment)8. Sounds good9. Easy to useLet's explore:1. The ANC works very well and maybe too well. I was chastised because my wife was talking to me and stated a question multiple times before shouting at me and then I barely heard her from 5 feet away. It easily blocks out normal frequencies of everyday life, however, the piercing shrieks of small humans chasing a dog will still cut through a little bit. The levels are very adjustable, but I like my fortress of solitude so I choose to leave it at max and deal with the consequences.2. I asked several people on calls using Teams, cellphone, and Zoom if they could hear the chaos ensuing around me and it was reported that they could not hear anything other than me, although it did sound a little different than normal. Call it a win. I will add that the self voice feature is nice so I can hear myself speaking an a little bit of what is going on around me when on a call. Off the call, we are back to the fortress.3. It claims to have 20 hours of battery life and ever so nicely informs me of the state of charge in hours when turning the headphones on. I have not tried to listen for 20 hours straight because that is silly, but I can say that I used these on-and-off for a week without charging and, during that week, used them for multiple hours each day. I'd say that is pretty good and no need to compare further.4. These will maintain a connection to two devices at once and my most common use to was have them connected to the computer and phone simultaneously. It maintains a solid connection to both and I can hear music on one and get notifications on the other. If I am listening to music from the computer and a call comes in, it seamlessly switches to the phone. Hang up the call and the paused computer music picks back up. Switching to another device is easy using the (wait for it) Bose app that actually works! I could never get the JBL app to work right and I would have to disconnect from the work computer and then go into bluetooth settings on another to connect. The range, for me, was anywhere in the house; only had cut out when I went into the garage on the other side of a metal door and metal wall. I almost forgot: When turning them on, it tells you which two devices it connected to which is super nice if you have them set up for several possible connections.5. These are comfortable to wear all day if need be. The headband and ear cup foam are squishy yet supportive. I had no issue wearing these in a normal setting. Of course you will have sweaty ears if it hot outside and wearing these or if working out; duh. I saw someone talking about wearing these to weedeat; not the right application and people make devices with an actual NRR rating for that application. For normal uses, these are going to treat you well.6. These are a high performing audio piece of equipment and the price actually doesn't reflect that when compared to what else is out there. Sure, they aren't cheap, but quality does come at a cost. I would say that, when compared to it's peers that I'm sure you will find doing your own research, these are a relative value.7. These were probably never designed for wet environments so don't put them there (some reviews talk about this as a con). Otherwise, these feel solid and are constructed well. The phones slide down the bar rather than the bar extending; I think this is a good design feature that will make them last longer over all due to less moving parts and also keeps them set up correctly. The toddler has already attempted to replicate his earlier feat, but the Bose held it's own. To increase the protection of your investment, Bose has seen fit to include a hard case for travel/toddlers.8. Ultimately, you want a nice piece of audio equipment to sound nice; these do. They really, really do. I listened to my favorites on Spotify that I had heard a hundred times and picked up details I hadn't heard in songs before. Use the app that somehow actually works to adjust to your liking. I don't think these were engineered to blow out eardrums, but you can get a great bass thump if that is what you want. Overall, you won't be unhappy with the sound quality unless you are really looking to be unhappy with the sound quality.9. This one is maybe a bit nuanced; I think they are easy to use with the buttons and the swipe controls, but you might disagree. Some of it can be tailored in the app, but some of it will take a little getting used to. I do like having less physical buttons as opposed to more because I would inadvertently hit a button taking them off or putting on or I would fumble around for a button trying to do something simple like skip a song.Ultimately, my theme is function over form and these deliver on function. I am very pleased with the package Bose put together here and I think you will be too.",11/21/2023,AEWM4UY3QB6YNT3P5RKR62RUSOXQ,1,28,Color: Black
402,R16JB0IDA2TBD8,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Tons of great features which keep the headphones around your ears.... but for how long?,M. Greenberg,5,"I've owned these for half a day so far and have decided to keep them around. I'm an audiophile who spends money on kickstarter earbuds, custom-made preamps, and (in general) quality hardware which reduces my audio experience as little as possible. Trying these cans in-store at BestBuy allowed me to appreciate the hardware quality of the exterior... quality matte plastic moulding, amazing comfortable faux-leather surfaces on your skin, and a synthesized voice and audible feedback to assist with your navigation of the three hardware buttons and touch controls make these headphones easy to wear during work sessions, public transit commutes, or in a crowded home with loud kids. As a brand new product, the tension on the cans over your ears and on your head can become uncomfortable within an hour of use. Subjectively, I don't consider my head to be particularly large or larger-than-average and will need to play around with adjusting the cups to sit lower or higher on the band which also release/tighten the tension respectively to see if this becomes a long term problem with use. Taking short breaks with the headphones off (10-15 minutes) helps and gives a good excuse/reminder to take a break from work to relax the body/eyes/ears.The sound quality is reasonable for the headphones. When using the headphones with noise cancellation off, ambient noise seems to lack a very strong low end frequency response (sub ~250Hz, not measured) and might reduce your meatspace experience in some cases where mixed ambient and input audio are desired. That said, direct input still seems to perform quite well with solid frequency response all around which lets the very highs and very lows to be pretty well-balanced.A test using the headset for phone conversation over bluetooth yielded very nice results. The setup involved the cans paired with my laptop streaming music and my Project Fi Pixel 3 phone on standby. Using the Google voice assistant to start the call resulted in some clumsy voice detection/understanding problems (""I'm sorry, I didn't get that, who would you like to call? I don't know that name, who would you like to call? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Dialing..."" _sigh_) which I don't believe are the fault of the cans at all. The test included loud ambient music in the room with the person wearing the headphones and found the other user to experience practically none of the ambient noise through the call with a very clear bead on the callee's voice despite close proximity to the music source playing at a moderate volume (such that the ambient music was leaking through the room walls and making it hard to isolate whether the headphones were leaking the ambient noise into the call...which it seemed _not_ to do with this casual test setup). Noticeable was the (300-700ms) delay from the user on the headphones which seemed to not be present from the non-headphone user. It was hardly a concern and either due to the latency in the network transmitting the audio (which, again, was a local wifi call between handsets.... though I am unsure if the handsets route audio locally or not) or possibly in the audio processing from the headset. This latency was par for most mobile calls and should be completely unnoticeable in a remote environment when you're not there to hear to source before the transmitted audio through the headset.A few gripes about the design and ergonomics of the device:- the button placement: very easy to accidentally active these buttons which adjusting the placement of these cans if not aware/careful.- the direction of earcup rotation: when placing the cans around the neck/shoulders, the earcups rotate up (into the air) rather than down (onto your chest). Questionable choice here as it makes the headphones somewhat uncomfortable to hold there, but perhaps Bose never expects you to remove the phones... unsure if that's a reasonable expectation or not.- the synthetic leather matte black surface inside the top of the headset and on the earcups attract oil and will certainly show for those of us with that sort of skin. This may require some extra TLC and upkeep to keep as pristine as one might like. The white set might fair better in this regard.Overall summary:A pricey purchase that I would have trouble justifying as a personal expense (these were expensed by my employer and intended for daily voice conference usage and isolation during work hours in busy coffee shops) and really comes down to the longevity of the product over time. If these headphones end up lasting me longer than 5 years, I would be VERY satisfied with the purchase. At a price point closer to $250-300, this would be a much easier personal purchase to make.As a user which ""babies"" their hardware, I am eager to see whether this will stand the test of time. Direct input (from a bluetooth source that is not ambient noise) has a very solid frequency response which does not noticeably detract from the music experience. Longterm use may be uncomfortable depending on your head size. The noise cancellation works wonderfully and almost too well, leaving me at a ""5"" setting more often than a ""10"" as complete cancellation feels too isolating and uncomfortable to feeling the lack of ""air"" around me. BLE connection to multiple devices (two) at once allows for seemless transitions between either input. This is also a first time purchase of a Bose product. Looking forward to seeing how the device matures and support is handled over time. Firmware updates are provided automatically to the headset through their app. Battery life ""appears"" long but I have yet to complete a full discharge cycle to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find the phones report +5 hours of use remaining at 20% battery charge and +20 hours at full charge (the audio assistant delivers the charge level as ""hours of use"" remaining, not battery level...which is still viewable in the Bose Music app. Nice touch, Bose).",07/4/2019,AFNPMOFXKDZE25GWBXZVB5CWBFYA,1,135,Color: Black
403,RBX1DH9DN58AS,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredibly More Comfortable and User Friendly than all the Sony’s,Jenna May,5,"I decided to buy 4 sets of Noise Cancelling headphones and then send back the 3 loser (with the intention of giving objective feedback).***My primary priorities were noise cancellation and comfort. My secondary priorities were sound quality and user friendliness. And finally style.The four headphones that I compared were...Bose 700’sSony WH1000XM4’sBose 350’sSony WH1000XM3’sIn short, I ended up keeping the Bose 700s (and that was an easy decision based on my priorities).I have a little bit of bigger head and found the 700s much more comfortable than any of the others...by far! My wife has a smaller head and she tried the 700s and found that they didn’t fit her head well and preferred the Sony XM4s. However I can wear the Bose 700s for multiple hours and they feel great!!!I found the noise Cancellation to be equal in quality with the Bose 700s and the Sony XM4s. But I found the Sony XM4s to create a slight uncomfortable noise/feeling. Some people could find this troubling but it wasn’t a big deal for me.I found the Bose 700s and Sony XM4s have slightly better ability for noise cancellation than the Bose 350s and the Sony XM 3’s. However the Bose 700’s allow me to push a button to 3 different noise cancelling settings which is kind of nice.When it comes to sound quality the Sony XM4’s win by a long shot. And if I were only going to wear these for a few hours I would probably have bought the Sony XM4s. However I tend to travel internationally on flights that are 8+ hours long and so the comfort was more significant than the sound quality because the Bose 700s are still very good in their sound quality and I can adjust the EQ to my preference.The final decision maker for me was the user friendliness. The Bose 700s were so easy to set up and use. (This is also why I prefer apple products...simplicity). I found the Sony’s to be much more complicated, confusing and the touch sensors to be a bit clumsy and less responsive. I also found the Bose 700’s very easy to quickly put away in their storage case (which is a nice hard case for travel).The Bose 350s were also very simple to use and the sound quality was decent. But their comfort and noise cancelling was lesser than the Sony XM4S and the Bose 700s.The Sony XM3s are once again better in sound quality and between the Sony XM3s and the Bose 350s I would go with the Sony XM3s. Both fit on my head similarly...so equally uncomfortable for long term wear (great for my wife with a smaller head but not me with a bigger head).Obviously I’m not considering price in any of these comparisons. Because comfort was a much bigger priority to me than price...I needed something that would be worn comfortably for multiple hours despite the cost. If you’re looking for cost effectiveness the Sony XM3s or Bose 350s are the way to go (so long as they fit your head like they do my wife’s)For perspective my head is 23 inches round. My wife’s head is 20 inches. Our ears are average/not big so our ears fit just fine in all of the headphones listed above.When it comes to style the Bose 700s are incredibly sleek and modern...very stylish...especially the grey ones (which is what I bought). We found the grey Bose 700’s and Bose 350’s are much better looking than the Sony XM4 or XM3s. In fact I found the black Sony’s the only color I’d consider. So if color is something you’re considering and you want something besides black then both sets of the Bose are the way to go. But the 700’s take it to a whole new stratosphere and my teenage daughter wants to wear them (but they’re not leaving my head and I don’t think they would fit her very well as she has a similar size head as my wife). If I were buying some for her, I’d buy the grey Bose 350’s.Finally all of these have relatively strong batteries. The Sony’s are probably better overall but the Bose 700’s charge quickly and I can easily get 20+ hours of listening out of them before needing to charge them. Fifteen minutes of charging will get me a few hours.Let me be clear, all 4 of these headphones are REALLY nice! And so you need to consider your priorities and then choose accordingly and I think you will then be happy with whatever route you go.",10/7/2020,AF5MZAGDLIB4RO72FX2S5F3YUGRA,1,79,Color: Silver Luxe
404,R3BW6NTUT6GTYF,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great NC and wireless, a few gripes",Jordan J,4,"I received these a few weeks ago and feel an appropriate amount of time, activities, and use of the 700s has been had for a review.The build quality is very nice. I typically use these everyday for long periods of time and they are sturdy with no signs of wear. They are comfortable enough when worn appropriately. I have a habit of uncupping one ear instead of turning NC to 0 which can lead to discomfort around the ears and top of the head. This is no fault of the product however. The buttons and controls work well with iOS, Siri, and Alexa in my experience. Playback controls on PC do not always work as seamlessly, with skip often not working in some applications.Noise cancellation is as good as it gets. Not much to expound upon, if this is the most important feature for you, fret not.In addition to great NC, the call quality is worth mentioning because it may be the 700's most outstanding feature. I've had calls with distraction level noise disturbances in my vicinity and clarity is just as good, if not better, than my iPhone's default mic. You can also tune how much of your voice comes through to your ears to make conversation feel more natural.I'll use this feature to segue into the Bluetooth functionality, the Bose music app, and use on a non-mobile device.Connecting to two devices at once works surprisingly well. It's very easy to get audio from the source I want with a simple pause x, play y. Range in my house is almost unbelievable, I haven't tested it's limits but clear across my house through the drywall I'm still connected.The Bose music app for iOS is atrocious. When it works it's great, but on a consistent and frequent basis I have to kill the app and restart to avoid a totally pointless login screen. If that isn't the issue, the app often doesn't acknowledge that the phone is paired with the headphones despite them actively streaming audio from the device. This has caused me to re-pair the headphones with the app on occasion which is annoying. Even when working properly the app is sluggish and seems unresponsive.You can customize how long the headphones remain on when no audio is transmitted to the headphones in addition to a lack of motion (though they have still shut off on me despite motion). Bose claims a battery life of 20 hours, my app consistently reports 17.5 hours on a full charge. If you charge it at night or once a day, it's really not an issue even with all-day use.Sound quality is perfectly fine for the average user. If you're looking for studio level audio clarity, I'm not sure why you are reading this review. These are wireless NC headphones, and the sound quality great for that purpose. They don't get as loud as normal headphones, which is kind-of the point of NC. Bass can feel muted if you're used to heavy bass, but bass heavy music sounds fine to me and is probably a more subjective issue.Overall, if you want top quality NC headphones and have the $400 to shell out, go for it. If you're upgrading from other NC headphones it may not be worth the money, maybe test them out at a Bose store or wherever they are sold retail. The app functionality really needs to be addressed so maybe wait to see if Bose can ameliorate the problems if you already have headphones. If making and receiving calls is your main use case these are a safe purchase.I will update if anything changes.",07/27/2019,AEDSSNSRFQBDP5QOFAO4W6P6LA5A,1,8,Color: Black
405,R24FAAZHB4ASS3,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable quality bluetooth headphone,Tara,5,"This headphone is one of the most comfortable I've ever put on my head. I can easily wear it all day (16 hours straight) without getting a headache despite being migraine prone. The weight of the headphone is barely noticeable, and it's easy to adjust the fit. The sound quality is exactly what you'd expect from BOSE. Installing the BOSE app just means being able to customize the equalizer to your preference (among other things), but it's not a requirement. The noise cancellation feature is awesome, and it can also be customized via the app. And I can't rave enough about the way the noise cancelation feature works with the mic.I've been using my headphone daily for over a year, and I still have no battery life issues. I can count with one hand the number of times I end my day with no charge left in my headphone.It did take a small learning curve to figure out how to use the headphone, but it's a small trade-off to all the conveniences and values of this headphone.Overall, although the BOSE headphone is a bit on the pricey side, it's definitely worth the money.",06/20/2024,AG7VSWGILSYRXQWJ5MYMD2FQJ5VA,1,1,Color: Black
406,ROJWAM02GVDYW,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones option for remote workers with Unified Communication USB connector,Andrew,5,"I have owned/used the Jabra Evolve 75 for 4 years. I have owned and used this Bose product exclusively for ~2 months. I bought it to replace my Evolve when the boom mic stopped muting the headset.I work from home full time and use them 3-6 hours a day. I'll compare the two products a bit here for people who might be familiar with that one.In short: It's a really nice headset, albeit one with some quirks. If you want a single headset for work and music, get the Bose NC 700 (with UC if you also use a supported team meeting product, like MS Teams). If you want a headset for work only then you should also consider/compare the Jabra Evolve 75PROS:- Extremely comfortable when the room you are in is at a comfortable temperature,- Quite comfortable for people who wear glasses. The Evolve 75 was less comfortable with glasses due, I believe, because of the design: the Bose fits around your ear and the Evolve 75 sits on top of your ear, which would push it into the glasses and your head. Never a huge deal, but one thing I noticed with them after hours of use wear- With UC connector (sold separately or as a bundle with headphone), the controls work with a couple of the leading video conferencing products- Noise canceling is incredible...absolutely fantastic.- A pleasant voice and sounds telling you what is going on when you hit most of the controls. The Evolve 75 has voice feedback as well- Charges very quickly...30 minutes will get me through my work day- Music sounds wonderful on them. I would not use the Evolve 75 for music if I had other options around like thisCONS:- When your room is hot the Bose is not as comfortable as the Evolve 75. I think this is because the Bose encases your ears while the Evolve sits more on top of the ear- I find the touchpad controls much less accurate than physical button. Hold the touchpad for the right amount of time to mute/unmute means I'm wrong some amount of the time. The Evolve 75 was way more simple...move the mic boom up and you are muted, move it down and you are not- The manual is not very good. Did you know that the UC USB nub has a button to set bluetooth to discovery mode? The manual doesn't tell you that and the button is so well placed and designed that it doesn't look like a button at all- The software to update/use the Bose it is awkward at best. Jabra's software updater is much cleaner- Does not come with a stand to put it when not in use. The Evolve 75- If you want Unified Communications you need to buy a $75 USB nub, or buy the NC 700 UC package. The Evolve 75 has it all in one package/price- When paired to your phone and your computer (via UC nub) it gets confused when you get a phone call while on a work meeting. I tend to disconnect it from my phone during working hours for this reason...the Evolve 75 handled two devices better- Uses a very different cable to charge...sort of like a hollowed-out USB-C...and the supplied cable is so short you cannot charge and use the headset at the same time. The Evolve 75 can be charged and used a the same time easily...if you ever even had to do this, as the stand it comes with will charge the phone as well if its plugged into a USB portNEUTRAL:- Battery life is satisfactory...I go a couple days between charges- A bit higher price than the Evolve 75- I found the Evolve 75 to have better signal range",07/22/2021,AGU7CAMNO6S2Y3CHIZ5BGDDOT65A,1,8,Color: Black
407,R197DHP87C93CG,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars Awful,Jason Brannock,1,"I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. With the full review there, I'll keep this one more focused on N700 vs E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.Microphone and PlaybackThe B700 was not tested because there were enough other reasons not to even consider them. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileE285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). I couldn’t get the “thump” from the B700 no matter what I tried. The B700 does have an EQ, but it’s far more basic than what Jabra and Sony offer, like a ball point pen vs a fountain pen. Sure, the ball point will get the message across, but one can’t deny the fountain pen its grace as it glides like butter across the page, leaving streaks of variable line widths and drawing you in –sorry, wrong review. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandBose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location. There are two different apps and both suck, but the one for B700 is especially awful (Bose Music). Just the first time using the app for setup, it crashed. It periodically failed to detect the headphones, even after the latest firmware instalment. It’s worth mentioning the Bose Music app is far worse than the other Bose app (QC35II uses Bose Connect). I had far too many connectivity issues within the first hour to justify keeping the B700 (yes, I requested a return within an hour).Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. Again, B700 was not put through this test because it sucks.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. The E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. Didn’t bother trying the B700 because of the numerous issues with just one connected device. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Put succinctly, the E285 needs work, especially when using it with the PC. But at least it has it!App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then; unless you’re Bose Music, in which case you’re a swarm of locusts after a century rest furiously attacking unsuspecting victims taking what was supposed to be a nice meander down the side of the Nile River. Does it remind you of a curse? It should. I succumbed to believing the $400 I used to purchase them came from the time I was standing on a burial ground when my check came through my account. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantCouldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature. Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. Between the B700 and SX4, I found the pole in the B700 to be much more in the way and therefore the SX4 provides better usability. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleWhile the B700 has the tightest grip, it actually slides off the easiest, I guess because the top band is the slimmest of the pickings. Also, it’s far easier to accidentally move the ear cups because they’re really loosely attached to their sliding pole. Win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable). Don't care to spend time rating the B700.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesB700: flat out sucks with just ONE connection. I’m constantly having to manually re-connect, and not just a simple “re-connect”; I mean force-stopping the app, forgetting the headset from my phone and vice-versa, holding down the Bluetooth button to make the app realize it’s there, allowing my phone to pair, etc. Over and over. Can’t imagine the issues I’d be having if I set it up with two devices.There’s some variability with the Google Assistant functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while I give the B700 one star. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. But the B700 was far more aggravating and there was no comparison between it and the other three headphones. Also, Bose REQUIRES your location, which is extremely stupid. They're headphones, you don't need my location. While I ultimately ended up with the E285, if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.",02/13/2021,AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,1,127,Color: Silver Luxe
408,R3AH4ZU7UTBZJ3,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Non-Biased Review of Beats vs Sony WH-1000MX3 / WH-1000MX4 vs Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700,Dave & Laura,4,"This review is my personal experience using both headphones. I recently lost my Sony Headphones and decided to buy Bose Headphones. Here are some differences I have found between all three, and how I feel currently using Bose Headphones.Make sure you update any headphones firmware, some issues you may experience could be fixed (with any electronic). Understand that headphones in a warehouse are likely from the year they were manufactured, and first versions of anything tend to be buggy.PERSONAL USAGEI use these headphones primarily for work. I’ve been full time remote for over two years doing software development. I have ADHD and having noise cancelling headphones is a must to keep my attention on work. We use mostly Slack and Zoom as our means of communication. Otherwise, I’m listening to music or the occasional YouTube TV.PERSONAL PREFERENCESI really don’t like using in the ear headphones. They hurt my ears after an hour or so and never were a long-term solution. Over the ear headphones was what I liked the best since that’s what works for me. This has been throughout my life, and they tend to fall out.BEATS – NOT FOR ME OR MY HEADMy first pair of headphones were Beats Solo. I was really impressed with wireless headphones in general. Eventually after the Solos started to fall apart, I decided to get Beats Studio 3. These worked much better for my head, as these were truly over my year, which I prefer.The functionality is about the same between the two. With a lot of usage, the earpieces came worn out and unglued and I had to buy replacements. Compatible quality replacements are about $30 from different manufacturers.• Pros – Lots of colors. Foldable, and buttons are more clicks than touch sensitivity. Useful when sweating or outdoor use.• Cons – Quality. Wore down quickly and were not a long-term solution. Paying more for royalties to Dr. Dre than quality assurance in general. Feel cheap.FIRST DECISION – Sony WH-1000MX3I was fortunate to try out both headphones from a family member. I was skeptical about Sony since it wasn’t the name brand Bose was for what I wanted. I really like how they felt on my head, and they didn’t hurt after wearing them for hours.There wasn’t a noticeable difference in sound quality. Features needed matched what I needed at the time and figured there was no point in spending more. My work-at-home situation was different, and I was at home around 40% of the time. The case was useful when transporting in my backpack back and forth to work.Once I transitioned to full time work-at-home, some of the features that I found useful weren’t available on the Sony’s. One big thing I would like to see is app integration. Mute / Unmute for Slack and Zoom would really be a great feature. Understandably, these are headphones, and are limited to what Bluetooth has to offer.The app is useful, and more powerful with customization than the other two. I found I used it a couple of times.Over the three years I’ve used these, the product quality and sound we’re just like day 1. These headphones seem to be built better than the other two.• Pros –Very durable and well built. Sound quality is great and felt good after a day’s work. Slept with these on a bus trip. That was my last memory. Cheaper than the Bose. Foldable, smaller case.• Cons – Less features than the Bose. Misses on some sweet spots. Harder to see which is left and right when putting them on, but not really a big deal.SECOND DECISION – Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700Once I realized I may never see my beloved Sony Headphones again, I needed something right away since work call quality was terrible. Before I pulled the trigger on the same Sony’s, I wanted to look at to what Bose offered that Sony didn’t. The biggest was a feature to mute / unmute. When pouring over reviews like this one, that feature was worth paying up. Since these are new headphones, I am still getting used to the controls.I’ve only had these for a month. Was it worth paying up for it? Honestly, I don’t know yet. There are more controls on the headphones which I’m figuring out.So based on a month, here’s what I found• Pros – Seems like better sound quality. More features and possible mute integration.• Cons – Price and unproven personal durability experience.TLDR / OVERALL REVIEWI won’t even compare the Beats headphones. Sony and Bose are a step way above Beats.METRICS• Sound Quality – Bose slightly. My ears are bad, I’m not an audiophobia as others may be. Spotify is what I listen to primarily. The slight edge goes to Bose, only because it’s a small enough difference.• Mute / Unmute – Bose. The main reason for choosing Bose instead of Sony for my current headphones.• Noise Cancelling – Leaning towards Bose. There is customization of three different settings within the Bose app to set up preferences from 0-10. Sony sort of has the same thing, but not directly.• Microphone – Sony. Never had any issues of cutting out or “robo voice”. Initially I am “cutting out” and “in a wind tunnel” from peers.• Bose - Multiple Device Connectivity (multiple Bluetooth Connections) was a feature I didn’t even think about. Bose allows for multiple connections which comes in handy. I found myself unpairing and pairing devices with Sony. It was sort of a hassle that seemed unnecessary. If the Bluetooth source device is off, it should default to another.• Headset Features, Bose wins. Although I haven’t had the time to get into what the buttons do, there are more of them. The buttons themselves seem a little better than the Sony’s.• Headset Quality – Sony. I really don’t care for the artsy plastic that goes over the top of your head. Sony also folds up where Bose doesn’t. An argument can be made that the Bose are lighter than the Sony’s, but that didn’t matter to me.• In the box – Sony slightly. Sony included an airplane adapter where Bose did not. I prefer the case from Sony than I do from Bose.• Daily Use – Too Early to determine, likely Sony. Sony’s headphones were excellent, as of now I haven’t used the Bose headphones.• Bluetooth Range – Bose decisively. Bluetooth location hasn’t changed. Dead spots where I wore my Sony’s didn’t exist with the Bose. There is a little bit of breakup in the headphones in dead spots, but nearly not as much as the Sony’s.• Companion Application – Bose. Much more customization of buttons versus Sony.WINNER – SonyI’m going to put a disclaimer on this, so take this for what it is.With my new set of Bose Headphones, there is a problem with the microphone. Assuming that this was just a fluke, I returned them since they were defective. So, my review is irrelevant of that from that aspect.Both are great, I lean Sony just because of the price difference.I wanted to give the Bose Headphones a little more time before getting a refund and getting the Sony’s again. Right now, they’re cutting out where Sony rarely did that. Even in that case, my computer was slow, or the application used went haywire. That’s something that’s a no-go for me. I ended up contacting Bose support, went through the normal stuff, is your battery charged, are you far away to a point they created a return ticket for a replacement. Once sent in, they would give me a new pair within 5 business days.Fortunately, after writing this review, I ended up finding my missing Sony headphones, which would be what I would have bought instead of a Bose replacement.As with any review, only you can decide if the extra money for Bose is worth it. I can see it both ways. For me, these headphones are for basic usage. The extra money wasn’t worth the upgrade. Defective products happen. I just hoped that their flagship headphones would have worked better. Regardless, spending hundreds of dollars to replace something missing is an instant return anyway.I hope this helped someone.

409,R2GUYB5T515UTB,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Concert Hall Quality Music,Thomas Walker,5,"I must immediately confess that my 5 Star rating pertains to one of 2 headsets. I'd been sold on the 700C by the Consumer Reports write up. As promised, finding one was challenging. Luckily, I found 2 pair for sale by Frontrow Tech LLC through Amazon that could be delivered quickly; important because I wanted them for forthcoming air travel my wife and I would take.The headphones arrived on schedule. I plugged the first ones in and - nothing. None of the trouble shooting steps I found on the Bose website helped. I plugged the 2nd pair in and, voila, signs of charging commenced. Once that finished I turned them on and paired them easily with my jukebox (phone). The musical reproduction was stunning. What's more, noise canceling levels are adjustable, so you can choose on that still allows diminished outside noise for situations when monitoring the exterior environment remains important.As to the defective pair, we were leaving on our trip the day after they arrived, so there would be no time to address the issue until our return. Once back home, I contacted Frontrow Tech through Amazon, who asked if I needed a return label. I replied ""yes,"" but also that I didn't just want to return the pair, I wanted to replace them. To my great disappointment, they'd had only the ones I'd bought. New ones elsewhere? Hens' teeth. Still, the working set amply validated CR's praise. Frontrow couldn't replace them, but handled the transactions promptly and professionally.I'm awaiting receipt now of a professionally refurbished pair from another supplier. I'm optimistic they'll work well.",06/22/2024,AFGMQ5UUJCWNZ6RFOU64LOY5UZKQ,1,0,Color: Black
410,R2O11NGJEXBTK0,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Work Headphones + Audio Bliss,Sam,5,"As an avid audiophile always on the lookout for top-notch sound quality and cutting-edge features, I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the Bose Headphones 700. Renowned for their noise-canceling capabilities, Bluetooth connectivity, and integrated microphone, these over-ear wireless headphones offer a premium audio experience. In this in-depth review, I'll delve into the key features, my impressions, and what sets the Bose 700 apart in the competitive realm of high-end headphones.Audio Quality:Bose has a well-established reputation for delivering exceptional audio quality, and the Headphones 700 live up to this legacy. The sound is rich, detailed, and immersive, offering a balanced audio profile suitable for various genres. Whether you're listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the clarity and depth of the audio elevate the overall listening experience.Noise Cancelling Excellence:The standout feature of the Bose 700 is undoubtedly its noise-canceling capability. The advanced technology used in these headphones effectively blocks out ambient noise, creating a cocoon of silence for an unparalleled audio experience. Whether you're commuting, working in a bustling office, or just seeking solace, the noise-canceling feature on these headphones is nothing short of impressive.Bluetooth Connectivity:The wireless connectivity of the Bose 700 ensures freedom of movement without compromising on audio quality. Setting up Bluetooth pairing is a breeze, and the headphones maintain a stable connection even at a distance. The absence of tangled cords adds to the overall convenience, making these headphones an excellent choice for those who prioritize a wireless lifestyle.Clear Calls and Voice Control:One of the standout features of the Bose 700 is its built-in microphone, designed to provide crystal-clear calls.

The responsive touch-sensitive surface allows for effortless control, adding a touch of sophistication to the overall user experience.Minor Cons: Fit SensationWhile the Bose Headphones 700 excel in many aspects, it's worth noting a minor consideration regarding the fit sensation. Some users may find that the over-ear design results in a somewhat looser fit than expected. While the plush ear cushions provide comfort, the fit might not be as snug as some users prefer. This is a subjective matter, and individuals with smaller head sizes may experience a slightly looser fit. However, it's important to highlight that the overall comfort is not compromised, and the adjustable headband still ensures a secure fit for most users. If a more secure fit is a priority, potential buyers may want to try the headphones on before making a purchase decision. Despite this minor consideration, the Bose Headphones 700 deliver an exceptional audio experience that outweighs this subtle fit sensation for many users.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Bose Headphones 700 stand as a testament to Bose's commitment to audio excellence and innovation. From the immersive sound quality and industry-leading noise-canceling capabilities to the seamless Bluetooth connectivity and intuitive controls, these headphones redefine the standards for premium audio devices.

411,R1RUP3JGD9Z8F0,B07Q9MJKBV,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Terrible Software",Larry,2,"*Introduction:I bought the Bose NC 700 right around the new year in 2021, so about a month ago. Like many people, I've been working from home for the past year. However, I have 2 young children who can get noisy, so I wanted some noise cancelling headphones. Also, I like listening to music and gaming, so I'll address that as well. Here is my review, broken down by subject:*Noise Cancelling:When I set out to get a pair of noise cancelling headphones, my main priority was, of course, noise cancelling. Naturally, I gravitated towards Bose due to their fantastic history here. I have never owned a pair of active noise cancelling headphones before, so I can't really compare to anything. However, I can say they are amazing. Any low-frequency constant noise is basically gone. I have a small office room with 2 central air registers; I can't hear either of them with the headphones on. I can hear my kids when they are loud, but the ""punch"" is gone, and it feels like it takes a level 10 crying baby, down to a level 7. All of this is without music on. Turn any music on, and it becomes near impossible to hear anything. I mean it; turn on some rock or rap and kiss noise goodbye. I'm sure the offerings from other companies are great too, but these are wonderful at noise cancelling.*Sound Quality:Sound quality is difficult to measure as it's subjective, so I'll try my best. I think the Bose NC 700's sound quality is pheromonal. I can hear lots of fine detail, and nothing has ever felt clipped or muddy, unless the music itself is. I personally really like the sound signature (think how the headphones are tuned, not how ""good"" they are), but a lot of people want more bass. Keep in mind, these do have good bass, but they won't turn your brain to mush. I am not a bass lover, so these are great for me. I typically stream Spotify from my computer or phone at the highest quality setting and set the app's EQ (see below for more info) to low = 0, mid = 2, high = 5. So, if you really want bass, I would try the Sony XM4's, but these sound really good and clear.*Design / Comfort:This is probably the trickiest for me to review. I’ll start with looks. I think they look cool and different from other headphones. They have a good amount of adjustability and feel pretty solid. They have 3 physical buttons: a noise cancellation level button, and voice assistant button, and a Bluetooth pairing / power button. However, I do not like the silicone headband. It feels cheap (to me at least) and isn’t overly comfortable. It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t feel good. Same goes for the leatherette ear cups. They’re fine, but do not feel premium. For nearly $400 I want something more luxurious. As a quick aside I’m 6’ 4” and wear glasses. After 6 ish hours wearing these off and on the tops of my ears where my glasses sit starts to hurt. The clamping force (for me) is a bit tight. You can reduce the clamping force by extending the earcups, but for my head it makes the earcups be too low, and that’s not comfortable either. It’s not a terrible thing, but I’m usually happy to take them off at the end of the day. That’s still almost a full work day’s time which is pretty good.*Battery life:They are advertised for 20 hours, I’m not sure how much time I actually get but it sounds about right. I usually charge them every other day or every 2 days. I like the battery is measured in hours rather than percentage. Since I don’t travel this isn’t a big deal anyways, but you can get better battery life from other headphones.*Touch controls:Touch controls work fine for me. I think this comes down to preference. I’ve had no trouble getting used to them, even swiping up/down for volume. Somehow the volume swipe considers your speed or force to change how much you adjust volume per swipe. A full swipe up / down is about 25/30% in windows.*Bose Music App:This section (and the next) is where my review goes off a cliff. I hate the app. When I first got the headphones, the “simple” paring that the little user pamphlet outlined didn’t work. I had to manually pair through my phone. When pairing with my windows 10 laptop, I initially couldn’t get it to work at all. I had to find this post: Steps to pair NC 700 headphones with Windows 10 - Bose Community - 293028 to get it to work. Also, my headphones came uncharged. Between the lack of charge and Bluetooth issues it took about 30-45 minutes before I first heard anything with the headphones.Sometimes, when you open to music app to change to EQ or something else, your headphones will not be detected. The only solution I’ve found so far is to reboot. This is extremely annoying since it takes about 10-15 seconds to reboot your headphones (see below for why that is).Another annoyance is that the self-voice level option for when you’re in headset mode is buried withing the app settings. This should be part of the initial settings when you first open the app. You also cannot map it to a tap combo short cut. I would love to be able to do that since I’m adjusting all the time due to my surrounding sound levels when I’m on a call.1 Last thing, and I wasn’t sure whether to put this in the app or headphone software section. You cannot disable the multiple Bluetooth connection feature. Are you on a zoom meeting on your laptop and you get a call on your phone? Guess what, your audio, both input and output, automatically switch to the phone ringing in your ears. Listening to Spotify on your phone and then the windows chime plays? The windows chime interrupts your music. Even if your windows volume is muted, the audio switch to no sound for the duration of the windows chime. This wouldn’t be a problem, if you could disable the feature. You could unpair and repair devices manually, but if you unpair your phone where the music app is installed, the music app will “forget” the device and you have to go through the setup process again for a new device. It’s mind-boggling stupid and I can’t believe this app made it to market as is. For reference I have a One Plus 6T. Related to this, I’ve never had a successful switch from computer to phone when a call comes in. I can hear the ringing initially, but not the caller once I accept the call. Also, they cannot hear me at all.*Headphone Software:The headphone’s software itself is annoying. Not quite as bad as the app, but far from good. Upon startup, the headphone’s voice will tell you the amount of battery you have left and the 2 devices you’re currently connected to. At first this didn’t bug me, but after a while, it is extremely annoying. Most of the time, I know what devices I’ll be connected to. Just let it be a triple tap shortcut or something similar.Also, there are definite problems somewhere along the chain of input microphone processing. Often my colleagues say I’m cutting in and out when I talk in lower tones. This usually occurs when the central air is running, and it’s input noise canceling is running. As far as I know, there’s no way to reduce or turn off the input noise cancelling. This is frustrating, since one of the selling points for these headphones is good mic quality. It’s very disappointing.*Summary:In summary the headphones sound great, but the day to day software issues make these a hard pass at $400. I don’t have the Sony XM4’s or other competitors for comparison, but I cannot recommend against these headphones enough. This will be the first and last Bose product I will own for a long time.",02/9/2021,AF3AN4FVHVKSIV6QHRSCL23HUEDA,1,12,Color: Black
412,R2CYY3DK4QPJOL,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Rehoming Bose 700 NC,David C.,5,"TL<>DR: They came with no damage and worked as expected with a 45% discount over brand new.I purchased my Bose 700 NC (black) as a used product and have always had great luck with refurbished and used products in the past.The level of engagement from the seller was great. They contact me to ensure I understood what I am buying and how it is going to arrive. It came off as a red flag when they replied to my reply. Came across as they are trying to convince me to not purchase the headphones. Ultimately, they have likely had issues with scams or illiterate customers.The headphones came in a tyvek bubble mailer via USPS. We recorded the opening, again I was worried with the level of outreach from the seller, and found no defects on the headphone case. Everything that comes with a Bose 700 was inside the case with no damage on the inside. The headphone have no physical defects and charged as expected.Read through the user manual and tested the volume up/down, skip/go back, the 0,5,&10 NC settings. We used YouTube Premium music and other audio types to test the audio. The quality is better than anything else I own and expect as much for the best rated NC headphones by Consumer Report.Testing the NC, I used the bubble mailer to generate sound and it is very obvious the noise cancellation works flawlessly. If a person uses loud voice you can still understand what is said, but normal communication at five feet apart and you can guess what is being said, if they look at you.The Bose app is rubbish, though. It recognizes my headphones and connects them to my Bluetooth, but they do not appear in the app for being able to change the settings. This is not a big issue as everything I need are already on the headphones.These were bought for when I travel to have headphones that do not roll around the plane if they fall out. But more importantly when a person takes a captive audience and yells for four hours in order for the person two chairs over to hear them.",03/12/2024,AG2QBI3YID3DHM5LV6I7B2ZBYJJA,1,1,Color: Black
413,RKQDJGXE6IK1D,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice noise cancelling headphones at a great price,Neal,5,"First of all, let me say that I am a semi-professional musician - I have sung in choirs, often with orchestras, for many many years. So, I know good sound - but keep in mind the ""many many"" part of it, as my hearing is likely not as good as it was 40 years ago. That said, for my use, these cans are great! I got them to be able to listen while I'm at work, shutting out the surrounding noise. They have a fairly flat response - not a strong bass, but in my opinion, most over emphasize bass, where I want realistic bass, which is what I get here. The noise cancelling is great - I use them while I'm vacuuming, and hardly hear the vacuum at all, right in front of me. I actually look forward to vacuuming, so I can listen to my favorite music!",05/19/2024,AHNHVKQK3LUTFUKIUITWGO27MKOQ,1,1,Color: Black

There products have lasted the rest of time each time I buy this. Average I keep Bose products for at least 2 years before I notice any quality defects and even those are minor issues with wear and tear.I personally have small ears so these over the ear headphones allow my ears to sit inside them giving a even better noise cancelling experience. I also have the earbuds as well and they work great still have having them for 3 years.10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone who's looking for a good set of head phones.

415,R1KCO78K6DA1GK,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Top notch noise cancellation headphone,Mark,5,"I’ve had the Bose 700s for 5 months and have been impressed with their all around performance. Now that the headphones have an update to add an equalizer they are tough to beat!Pros:Outstanding noise cancellationAdjustable noise cancellationNew equalizer featureExcellent audio performanceExcellent call performanceExcellent comfortAbility to connect to 2 devices at onceDecent battery lifeSleek modern looksCons:Bose Music app can be flakyOccasional break up of noise cancellation with extreme sounds.Not rated for water resistance at allToo expensive at regular priceBattery lasts for me about 8 days before I get to 20% battery remaining and I have a long commute. From a practical standpoint 20 hours is plenty. The battery indicator is pretty accurate at providing the remaining hours left although somehow it never gets past 19 hours at full charge. They fully charge in 2 1/2 to 3 hours which is as advertised.Great noise cancellation. Overall works the noise cancellation works well on a commuter train. Also good at blocking background noise in open space office. I've used it when doing yard work and it does a great job of saving your ears from power tools. It can’t block out everything but no headphones can. There is occasional leakage of voices from the side and back when someone is talking right next to you. It is best at blocking sounds from the front. I have noticed an occasional break up of the noise cancellation with some sounds such as loud jet engine during take off or with certain lawn tools but that is pretty rare. The adjustable noise cancellation is awesome since there are times I want to hear my surroundings like when I’m walking on city streets or need to make sure I am not making a lot of noise with headphones on when I’m at home.Another strong point is the call quality. People can hear me clearly during calls and you can adjust how loud your own voice sounds on the calls as well which is a nice touch. The 700s do a great job too of blocking out ambient sounds during calls when you are speaking.The Bluetooth connection is excellent especially with Apple products. Another plus is ability to connect to 2 devices at same time. Great for use of laptop and phone. Pairs easily with my Windows 10 HP laptop. Automatically switches audio to the active device. Also nice job of switching when you get a call on your phone.It remembers every device its connected to and automatically connects without pairing which is awesome. It did have hiccoughs sometimes not picking up your voice on video conference calls with Zoom and Webex but these have been resolved with the latest firmware update.Comfort is excellent. I was a little worried with them since I wear glasses but did not find that to be a problem. They do not get hot or uncomfortable when you wear them for several hours at a time.The ear cup touch controls work great. I can attest that they work fine in cold weather in below freezing temperatures in Chicago. They only get sensitive if they get wet. Sadly they aren’t even water resistant so take care wearing them in the rain.The Bose Music app works most of the time but has its glitchy moments. Occasionally it won't find my headphones even though they are paired and connected to my phone (the headphones still work fine even when to app doesn’t connect). Also sometimes the Music App doesn't successfully update the headphone software.I did an informal comparison between the Bose and the Sony WH-1000XM3 Noise cancellation was pretty comparable. I found the Sony’s too boomy in bass for me at standard settings. I prefer a more balanced sound the Bose provides. The 700s look way better than the Sony’s (and the QC 35s).This is not an audiophile quality headphone but for wireless noise cancellation the sound is excellent all things considered. Now that the latest firmware adds an equalizer you can FINALLY adjust the sound! The equalizer has bass mid and treble adjustments you access using the Bose music app and do make a difference in the sound quality. The 700s can create some thumping bass at max bass boost and likewise the treble and mid boost is substantial.So a few niggles but excellent in every other area. Highly recommended, especially when they are on sale!",05/16/2020,AE7OOPOQWCUNV3U7KFWABXT3YSTQ,1,30,Color: Black

420,R33VJOHEU1WGRN,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancellation. Wish the bass was clearer.,Jeffrey Imbody,4,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas, and she loves them! She let me try them, (only for a minute though, she wanted them right back). She works from home 2 days a week, and sometimes has to participate in conference calls, or just wants to work without hearing noise in the house.We have a dog. He barks, as dogs do, and he has a very loud and rather shrill bark. She has told me that when he barks, she can't hear him at all, and the noise filtering microphone, whereas it does not eliminate the sound of his barking completely, does a very good job of muting it so she doesn't have to explain our dog's behavior to her co-workers.I have not had a chance to play with the app, and my wife is not an app person, and has had some trouble making it work properly, but most of the functions of the headphones can be controlled on the unit, so she enjoys them very much as a stand-alone.I am a bit of an audiophile and a musician, and though I wish the bass response on these headphones was a bit more clear, (perhaps that can be adjusted with the app), I was amazed at the three-dimensional quality of the sound and the clarity of the digital signal in most ranges.I want a pair, but I am holding out for the quiet comfort ultra!! But if you are looking for headphones that are a bit more affordable and still have a great dynamic range and superior noise-cancelling, you can't go wrong with these!Having said all that, they look a little strange.

423,R1REMTV69YZ75J,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect Item,PATRICK,5,"The protein leather, earpieces, come apart @ about 3.5 years of ownership, based on my usage. Bose needs to improve these. Outside of that, it's a perfect item. This is my 2nd pair that I've owned. The previous one was obviously different & an older model, not as advanced tech. I had to get earpiece replacements for that pair. I might have to do that with this current pair if Amazon sells them. Or I might buy a new model pair or two because the technologies is better especially since there's been multiple years past. I can use one pair @ home and one pair @ work. It's cheaper if you buy a set of 2. Supposedly, Bose makes these better over a period of time. I use my current pair to listen to movies on YouTube, on my laptop. I live in an apartment and my laptop doesn't use loud enough volume. The movie is too pitchy so I can hear the entire dialogue of a movie by hearing using the headphones. It solves the problem. I'm thinking about wearing them @ work. I work in a manufacturing facility and we are allowed to wear to music as long as we do our work. It'll be cool if I use these @ work. I'll be the only one who use very expensive headphones with the best quality of listening to music and canceling noise.

First, I was shocked to discover that Bose forces you to download their app to even make the headphones work at all - the headphones will not function at all without it. Good luck if you are in an area without a live internet connection. I was not happy having to do this, but I downloaded the app. I then found out that you are FORCED to open a Bose account or your new headphones will stay non-functional! Further, unless you agreed with their privacy policy, AND give your headphones full-time access to your microphone, AND allow your location history to be downloaded, etc., YOUR HEADPHONES ARE NON-FUNCTIONAL!!! Even the new design is a step backward in my opinion as it tries to make the headphones do too many things with swipes and taps to the ear cups, etc. Sure, you can vary the volume by ""swiping"", but good luck in making small changes to get a desired level.",07/8/2019,AHW7FUKJDSH2SFXZAXW5SMI4XYVQ,1,9295,Color: Black

426,R3O9UUB8H9746Y,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great, not comfortable, awkward controls",jeffp,3,"I'd had the Bose 700 in my amazon cart for a few months, and when I saw them marked down 25% during a labor day sale, I decided to purchase. I bought these primarily for the ANC to help with office noise at work, and loud neighbors at home. Unfortunately I suffer from misophonia.The good:The ANC works very well. It's a bit less effective than earplugs or earmuffs, but much more comfortable and breathable. Solely with ANC enabled, ambient noises are silenced completely. I can hear nearby conversations but not well enough to understand them. Neighbor noises (dogs) are still audible but usually not triggering. Earlier today, I used these headphones to make a phone call while standing between two very loud industrial HVAC units outdoors, not only was I able to easily understand the person I was talking to, they understood my end of the conversation as well. And if I'm listening to music, I can really observe the music and outside noises are not a distraction.I'm an audiophile, and music sounds wonderful on these compared to the $50 bluetooth earbuds I've been using for years. Listening to classic rock ""remasters"" on the Spotify app, I can hear details in the music that I thought were lost outside of listening to original release vinyls on a high quality sound system. I haven't even tried listening to high-fidelity audio sources yet, or tried using the included aux cable instead of bluetooth. I'm excited to experience those.The bad:A coworker owns the Bose QC45 headphones and allowed me to try them (the reason I originally became interested in Bose headphones), and the fit of the earpieces on those are much more comfortable than the 700's. Unfortunately the Bose 700 becomes very uncomfortable to wear after a few hours. The ANC of the QC45 seems equivalent to that of the 700. I didn't listen to any music on them so I can't compare that.My major complaints are with the minimal user interface and unhelpful (for me) options. There is a button on the left earcup to toggle the ANC, and on the right earcup there are buttons for power and voice assistant. By default the headphones give voice prompts when powered on or when buttons are pressed - this is very annoying for me. Voice prompts can disabled in the Bose app but by doing that the headphones will no longer tell me Caller ID information when I get a call, though fortunately the phone still rings. Unfortunately there is no way to disable or change the 'power on/off' sounds. A humble beep would be sufficient to let me know when the headphones are powered on and connected - I don't want or need to hear loud symphonic flourishes across the entire spectrum of human hearing to let me know when the headphones have connected to my phone.The Bose 700 has a ""gesture"" surface control on the right earcup for playback control instead of having dedicated playback buttons like the QC45. I don't like surface controls in general, and I expect the earcup's finish will start showing fingerprints and wear from daily volume adjustments etc in a short time.I am going to test these for a few more weeks and decide whether I want to keep them or exchange for the QC45.",09/7/2023,AHBJVBZDVOSVEAPQKD36VDEV5GPQ,1,3,Color: Black
427,RXJ8DOI2DGR56,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Ultimate headphones for business travelers,Eric,5,"If you want to skip my review then just read this. If you are a road warrior don't hesitate. BUY THESE HEADPHONES.I am very much a DIYer especially when it comes to home audio. This I would NEVER waste money on a speaker system from BOSE. I can taylor something far better for a space for less money than any Bose system. So spending $400 on a pair of headphones? No way.However, two months ago I was watching a Mark Robert video on YouTube and he took 5 minutes to do a plug on these headphones. He has always seemed like a very genuine guy but even I was a little skeptical of what he showed. He was using the headphones to take a phone call while leaf blowing. He recorded the audio from the other side of the line to showcase the person he was talking to couldn't hear the leaf blower at all. I was dumb founded and wanted to try it for myself.I travel 30 to 40 weeks out of the year. I'm constantly taking conference calls from busy restaurants and airports. Let alone can I not hear anything, the folks on the other side of the line can't hear me either. Then of course in annoying everyone in the space I'm in because I talk loudly to try and make up for it.The Bose 700s fix ALL OF THIS. My first try was in front of a bus stop at a busy airport. Waiting for a bus shuttle I took a conference call that I had to do a lot of talking on. The first thing I noticed is the noise cancelling let a little noise in. This allowed me to hear myself normally so I don't talk too loudly and disturb those around me. Next I could hear everyone on the call perfectly. Finally everyone on the call could hear me and hear none of the background noise. Literally nothing. They were shocked at the end of the call when I asked them how I sounded and they assumed I was at home in my office. I told them that in that time busses were whizzing by and people were yelling about which bus had arrived... They couldn't believe it.For that reason alone it is the best Bluetooth headset on the market.Now does it have the best noise cancellation? I think it could be better, but it's pretty near perfect. Other than really loud noises or high pitched sounds everything is blocked out. In fact I'm usually afraid I will fall asleep on the bus I take to the airport and miss my stop. The sound quality is fantastic and the battery life is great. I was worried seeing there are other brands offering 30 to 40 hours. I usually always have 10+ hours left after I get home from my trip and that's with no charging in between.Finally the controls are super intuitive. I was worried at first. These touch controls are always a gimmick. Then the amount of buttons on it too I was worried I wouldnt be able to figure it out and I would just never use the controls. In two days I had it down perfectly. Being able to easily skip tracks, turn down volume, pause music, and turn off noise cancelling is super useful.I'm sure you can find better head phones for music, better head phones for noise cancelling, or ones with better battery life. I guarantee you will not find ones better for taking phone calls that give you this incredible of an experience on top of it. These are clearly the best all around head phones and worth every penny.",10/31/2019,AHNYLWTLJZSS4JVZ44WDUMX7SD7A,1,15,Color: Black
428,R37AB5H6F760K0,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good but not great wireless headset,Rocky Soamc,4,"Overall a very nice set of headphones with good build quality. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I expected them to be on par with the Sony XM-5 headphones that I also own. The noise cancelling is probably 80% as good as the Sonys and the sound quality is close but is let down by a very lackluster app that gives you fewer tuning choices when compared to Sony's cluttered but otherwise excellent app. The build quality is probably a bit better than the XM-5 which seem to be step down in build quality from the previous XM iterations. I attribute this to sony playing the green card and trying to use all recycled materials for the XM-5s. Very nice sounding and good connectivity and battery life but I definitely would recommend the Sonys over these.",02/23/2024,AFH7EWSZGJ5SANZTGPSUR4CWONZQ,1,2,Color: Black
429,RZWXXJU3JEHX,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Noise Cancelling,Bert Cano,4,"I had a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones that I had owned for about a year and a half that started having issues with the noise cancelling so I decided to give these a shot. This review is largely a comparison between the two.NOISE CANCELLING: The noise cancelling is really good.I would say that the actual noise reduction is equal to the Sony's. However I noticed that when I was cutting my nails, the nail clippers clipping-sound induced an audible pop in the headphones, almost jarringly so. So it seems the headphones don't agree with any close, loud, sudden, and slightly higher frequency sounds. I've only had these for a few days, but it seems as though there is no way to turn the microphones *off* even if the ANC is set to zero. ANC on zero sounds like the microphones around the headphones are still picking up and emitting outside sounds. I could be wrong but it sounds that way to me. Other than those two nitpicks the noise cancelling is quite good.AUDIO QUALITY: Compared to the Sony's the audio quality is... okay.It sounds as though the stereo spectrum is quite narrower than the Sony's. If you're not sure what that means, imagine yourself listening to a piano. Imagine that piano being played in a hallway. Now imagine that piano being played in a concert hall. Bose = hallway, Sony = concert hall. It also sounds as though the frequency spectrum isn't quite as full. To me it also sounds as though the audio transmission between device and headphone is of lower quality. Its like max quality on these is 480p, while on the Sony's its 4k. I have to assume that the Sony's have better Bluetooth hardware? Idk.MULTIPLE DEVICES: Fast and seamless.Compared to the Sony's, the 700's ability to switch between devices is much faster and more seamless. No complaints here. The software to connect new devices is also easy to use.COMFORT: Very comfortable.I actually just realized I've been wearing these for about 4 hours straight and they haven't made me feel like I've needed to adjust them. The Sony's are also very comfortable but I felt like I had to adjust those on my head more. The 700's feel slightly lighter so that's probably why.OVERALL: Good.Probably not worth $400 honestly. If they were priced at $250-$300 I would say that that could appropriate. Don't get me wrong though these, so far, are great if you've never had a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 lmao. Saying that feels almost unfair lol but that's how I feel. The sound quality is just not amazing for $400. If you're coming from earbuds or something you might not notice, but these are $100 more than the Sony's right now and it seems as though the only thing they do better is switch between devices a second or two faster.I will keep these until Sony comes out with a new model and then get that and keep these as a backup.",02/13/2022,AEUKHADSHV2W3XSVATH6BHIWPT7Q,1,0,Color: Black
430,RM3BF76NRIU1X,B07Q9MJKBV,2.0 out of 5 stars OK headset with major flaws.,Caleb,2,"These are my work headphones I use in the office and while traveling. I've had them just under 2 months and I am already looking to spend my own money on new headphones to replace these. The sound is fine, the noise cancelling is really nice, the mic isn't good, but better than my previous set. They fit loose but very comfortable when sitting/standing upright and the ascetic style of this headset is pleasing. However, there are big issues that really degrade the experience.Because of how the earcups rotate and how you have to place headset on your head, you cannot use these headphones lying down on your back. The ear cups fold off your head and there is not enough resistance or a locking mechanism to hold them in place. I also mentioned that the headset is loose. For me personally, the band does not provide enough compression to sit snug on the head so when you move around, they tend to slip about too easily. As such, the seal of the earpads is tenuous, causing interruptions of the noise cancelling effect simply by turning your head too quick or you jog a bit to catch a train before the doors close.The touch controls on the headset are not the most responsive, but OK to use from time to time when needed. The buttons are terrible. They give very easily, meaning the slightest touch or even a brush against your coat collar can trigger it. The power button is a single press and not a press-and-hold, which leads to constant accidental power ons and offs when: handling them to put them on/away, while jostling in their case, and when adjusting the cups on your head. A dedicated power switch with some resistance to prevent accidental power on/offs would be much better. The problem here is the headset has an auto off function and you can change the time the headset stays on for. Some might utilize this feature, but I never do; personally, it's a hindrance. The mute button is right next to the power button so reaching for mute is a 70/30 chance you hit the right button. The only way you can tell you are muted/un-muted is a voice notification right when it happens, there are no LED or physical switch orientations to tell you otherwise.With there being two buttons, one on the left cup and one on the right cup, and having the touch zone on the earcup, you would think the required phone app would allow you a lot of customization...NOPE. You can customize one button and you have two options for it. That's it. The app is terrible and a huge contributor to why I dislike this headset. In order to connect the headset, you have to go through the app and I never know when it's actually connected. It will say I'm connected, but I get no audio and no mic. I can't simply disconnect and reconnect the headset through the phone settings, you have to use the app too. Then the headphones won't go into pairing mode and the app can't find them. It's incredibly annoying, especially when you need to connect for a meeting and the required software is impeding the hardware.You can name your headphones something to be identifiable in your device settings through the Bose app, which is nice when you have a big list of connected Bluetooth devices. However, you can't rename or give nicknames to the devices you are connected to in the Bose app. Every time I connect to my work computer, it spells out the long random PC name I can't change because my work controls. It also mutes the audio for everything you are connected to whenever the little notification voice pops up, so if something connects/disconnects or I mute my mic, I'm forced out of my conversation for a time, causing me to ask people to repeat themselves. I'm not 100% sure how it operates, but the headset can go into a sleep mode of sorts and a small beep tells you when it reconnects. Well some sites or programs I use cause it to ping almost non-stop which leads me to just turn the headset off.Also, does the battery last an 8hr workday? Yes. Does it last All-Day (14-16hrs)? Barely. It's about 20% battery for 2-3 hours, which will get worse with time. And you can't charge the headset while using it.Overall, it's just a frustrating experience that has room for improvement in a future model and some app updates. Once I find something that better suits my needs, I will shift the use of this headset to be only for desk duty, if not placed on a shelf or given to a co-worker.",10/7/2022,AHUSR2OZS5HK2WQTYNBT4CR7QMQQ,1,9,Color: Silver Luxe
431,R3VPOD5ACKDJ4M,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic headphones,Amazon Customer,5,My dog howls sometimes when I am in meetings and it is hard to concentrate.

Great quality and durability in addition to great sound.,05/7/2024,AHXN5HIF5CXNGKYVVAFDRSR53YYQ,1,0,Color: Black
432,R35U4IZQTFK4RC,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Product, Within Limits of Physics",Colin M. Shawhan,5,"I love the headphones! I barely heard a crying infant on a two hour flight to Salt Lake City. When I lifted one of the ear cups to test the NC the child, along with the background jet noise was louder. Was noise gone with the NC active? No, but the combine passive and active cancellation is impressive.Bose achieves a respectable reduction via the ear pads alone. They fit a bit tighter than some non-NC headphones but I believe this is a part of the equation. The ""old fashioned"" way of dealing with commuter noise was to crank up the volume, effectively listening to media at concert volume to drown out the outside world. That works but it's bad for your ears!Music sounds great, and if you want to crank it up the Bose 700's have plenty of volume. But if you are studying like I often do, or taking a private call then you can tune the voice to a comfortable volume and speech is intelligible. That's important for me as a business person and professional. If I have two hours to kill waiting for a connecting flight I am happy to crank up the tunes and shake my booty at the airport. Who cares? Dancing is better exercise than sitting in an awkward position fiddling with a smart phone.On to bass quality: for headphones? Pretty darn good. Bose 700's aren't professional gear, they are a high end consumer product: You get what you pay for. Can you buy $1,000 headphones? Sure. Are they better? A little. At this price point the 700's fit their niche.As an audio test, Dubstep sounded pretty amazing to me. I know what to expect from a good headphone and Bose delivers. Is the low end a bit of a psychoacoustic illusion? Yeah, but I know that. The 700's held at arms length will produce no audible bass. That's just not bass, period. But they sound bassy enough for me, and if you want license plate-rattling bass you probably need a car.Again, within the limits of physics Bose has done a great job here. I can't complain. Calls and recorded speech are great! Music is good enough for me, at least on the road. I can't take my home system with me when I travel so I know what to expect.Four stars for sound and bass, five overall for excellent ANC (20-25 dB I would guess). Speech and calls (at least on my end) are great! I can interact with clients and reps while exercising, getting coffee or doing just about anything besides operating a chain saw. For that reason I love the headphones! Is it the best music reproduction on the planet? No. But I'll take it while I'm stranded in Denver waiting for my next flight.Good job Bose!",05/20/2022,AEROHBBCRM7TESY3O5YRCC5WLP3A,1,5,Color: Black

436,RG8UDLRR9FZ1T,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars For me it is perfect, but depends on your use",Amazon Customer,5,"I’ve been a fan of Bose for a long time. I have the 25, 35, Gaming Headset, Aviation Headset and now the model 700. My original 25 broke the arm holding the ear cup and Bose replaced it for free, although it was just out of warranty. I now use the 25 (wired) for my home computer. The 35 my daughter “borrowed” permanently, and my gaming headset is at work. So, I wanted a wireless headset for TV, music, call, etc. at home. The Bose 25, 35, etc. are just very comfortable and perfect for my uses. But the 700 was a completely different style. For that reason, I was more interested in the 45.Price of course was a consideration, and at the time of Prime Days, the price difference was minimal.I’m not an audiophile, so I trusted other online reviews for a comparison of the model 45 to the 700 and Sony. My most trusted site for reviews of electronics is Tom’s Guide, and they had an excellent comparison. I finally chose the 700 over the 45 at the last minute. I made a good choice as I am very pleased with the headset. It is very comfortable, the sound is awesome, the touch controls are nice, and the equalizer was useful for increasing treble as I lost some hearing in that range, (too many concerts).The only negative I have found, which was mentioned in the online reviews, is that the headset clamps your head tighter than the previous models. This is fine for me wearing it for movies at night so my apartment neighbors don’t get upset. However, if you are wearing them for more than a couple hours, the model 45 might be a better choice.One additional note, which may be user or a software issue. I was having a hard time with the Bluetooth connection from my TV (LG) to my 35. I needed to delete the pair and re-pair many times. The model 700 connected every time so far.",07/21/2023,AEMYRJTWDIONAF5ZT4RRNHKGDHTA,1,24,Color: Black
437,R2KHN4AC1NRP0T,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars Weak sound and literally the worst return process on Amazon I've experienced,The Overlord,1,"I've been using V-Moda Crossfades for years but wanted to try something out with noise cancelling. These were highly recommended and after my sister got a pair and really liked them, I opted to give them a try. While the functional features seem to be really convenient, the lack of tactile feedback when using the headphones to navigate music is super annoying and it's too easy to accidentally brush/swipe the side of the headphone and fast forward or rewind a song unintentionally. The noise cancelling is a really nice feature and does work great, but the reasons I ultimately wound up sending these back are:1. The actual volume level max is way too quiet compared to my V-Modas and since I have a taste for loud music, this was really disappointing.2. The bass is weak as hell. My V-Moda probably have almost twice the bass production and it was very, very noticeable and messing with the EQ did not help at all (it just marks everything else quieter and honestly the EQ settings were pretty crappy anyways).Pros: VERY comfortable, easy to wear around your neck when you're not listening to them, voice works really well, controls are quick to respond, the app has a great UI, the battery life is great and the USB-c charging is a godsend. Noise cancelling is fantastic.Cons: Volume max is too quiet for anyone with even MILD hearing issues, bass leaves a lot to be desired, controls are too easy to bump and provide no tactile feedback.Conclusion: If you like heavy bass and tend to listen to the upper range of volume levels, I find my V-Modas are still way better. If you don't need it that loud and aren't so concerned about heavy bass, these are great headphones with a few minor nitpicks.Why 1 star overall, you ask? This has come down to the return process. I sent them in weeks ago and was only give ONE return option: Amazon Locker. I usually do UPS and they are immediate to process the refund as soon as my return is scanned by UPS and sent out to the returns center that day. I did 10 returns on the same day as these headphones, all via UPS with the exception of the headphones going to a locker. All were scanned that day. The other items refunded quickly. These, however, have been ""in transit"" for over two weeks now and have yet to refund. The return gives you zero indication on where the item is even physically at, let alone going, and for something I ordered and received within 3 hours of ordering, the fact that it's taking over two weeks for Amazon to receive the item (I live IN Seattle, BTW) is absolutely ridiculous. They were awfully quick to take my money but dragging their feet on this return, and customer service has been completely unhelpful. For whatever reason with locker returns you don't get your return until the return center itself receives the item, so if their courier messes up and loses your item, you're stuck waiting over two weeks before amazon will lift a finger to push your refund through and even then they are running me in circles. Nevermind the fact that it is not my responsibility what happens to this item once it has been scanned and picked up my the courier. If they lose it, I get a refund anyways, but have to wait for this arbitrary 2 week period *because reasons* (literally nobody can explain why it's like this with the lockers but not with ANY OTHER METHOD I've used for returns in the last 10 years). For such a pricey item, this has been an infuriating experience and quite frankly I'm at the point where I will never order something this expensive from amazon again if THIS is the kind of response I get when their courier or returns center has obviously messed something up. When I called again today, the agent told me it has arrived at the returns center and has been sitting waiting to get scanned. They said to wait 3-5 more days. That will make it 3 weeks. And then however long it takes for the banks to do their part. For someone who has been using amazon for a decade and easily spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on this platform (likely far more), this is a less than desirable process and I'm at the end of my patience. This refund should have processed when they scanned the item and NOT fallen on me to carry while their shipper either screws up and loses this item or takes their sweet slow time sending it to a returns center I can only suspect is located on another effing star system / planet. For an item I got in 3 hours.Good headphones, not good for mildly bad hearing, and literally the worst amazon return service I've ever experienced. First world problems, yes, but having had such an extensive hisoltory with amazon and doing god knows how many returns, I have plenty of context for how inexcusable CRAP this process has been in respect to allllllllllllllll the returns I've done in the last decade.Beware.",06/5/2022,AEGQTZFMGWX4KQJ3YEC3RF3UO6TA,1,17,Color: Black
438,RQ579YEPODZRZ,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Very good, for now, hoping it gets better",Vanished,4,"So i have tried the Bose QCII and Sony MX3s extensively. I loved the QCs the most purely due to comfort and dual connectivity... however both were terrible at taking calls/voice recognition/ mics etc. These definitely take the throne in that. As others have mentioned theres definite hiccups here but i am a little bit more patient. Bose is not a good software company. At first they did fit real tight as others have suggested but maybe i am getting used to it. I have used it one one flight so far and one thing i did notice was the plane rattles going through to the cup, which was a cause for concern... but as we speak i will use them on a flight again and maybe i didnt have them as snug as hey should be as i was wearing sunglasses. The noise cancelling is apparent but maybe not as insanely impressive as others have suggested- i can hear voices when music isnt playing. It totally mutes hisses, droning, etc.. but i can hear other noises- maybe thats an issue with my headphones? Not sure quite yet. This might be me, but i actually think the music quality got better the more i used them- i dont think these need burn in but i noticed it after a day of usage. They do get warmer than the QCs and they do fall forward n back more than the QCs used to. They certainly dont ""disappear"" like the QCs do but theres certainly trade offs. They QCs have an awful mic and thats a big deal for a lot. These have far superior noise cancelling than the QCs. The sonys are just too heavy for me and they fell off far easier if you lean forward or back. They also definitely do make your ears sweat. The NC 700s have similar touch buttons... i kinda hate them... possibly more so because they didnt just put them on both sides. I also think at this price these should have auto off for when you take them off akin to airpods or other such devices. I will be trying them out for a bit longer. I would go back to considering the QC35s but they've suspiciously gotten worse due to recent firmware.As far as design, they look good wearing them, but they look not so great on their own. I wished they'd have had more color options from the get go. I don't think they should be this expensive considering the features. The button lay out is a little confusing and the band sticking out as it does is not so great as in an airplane you are probably leaning on things and its a little more concerning than the QCs were but the same time these have the cusion on the outside too at some portion.All in all, i hope it gets better and i imagine they will make it happen considering the poor customer reviews so far. They can't afford to make this a failed product so i imagine they're going to crank out updates and newer features. The buttons should be customizable as you desire. The charging is fine. 20 hours vs 30 hours is similar, im charging it every other day anyhow. Hopefully the rattling that comes through isnt an ongoing issue cuz i really need something with a great mic. QCs are better comfort and fit wise but these have the tech you'd want in them. Who knows maybe we see an upgraded QC as well.",07/11/2019,AECFHWHKQGKQFL2TW7NC4HKBU7PQ,1,7,Color: Black
439,R1KLS6L3C6XV2A,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones, questionable interface",Anonymous,4,"These headphones are on par with the prior, and cheaper, Bose Quiet Comfort (QC) and Quite Comfort 2 headphones in terms of audio quality and comfort. The big difference is the interface, which is mostly worse.The instruction manual does not tell you how to control the headphones. You have to look for a YouTube video, which I cannot post a link to here because of a ridiculous Amazon rule against that. So here is a brief description of what controls you have and what they should have been.There is a pushbutton on the right speaker with a Bluetooth label. Press to turn on the headphones and hold to pair. This is fine, but the Bose QC had a better interface, a switch with an off, on, and pair position. The pair position had a springiness that had to be held to initiate pairing. That was a great interface.Below the power/pair button is a button to send a verbal command to the paired device. Without the Bose app, on an Android phone this will prompt you to either perform a Google search or make a call. With the Bose app, you can send the command to a voice assistant like Amazon’s echo. This interface is fine, but it would more sense to have two separate buttons for “ask…” and “call…”.On the left speaker there is a single pushbutton that toggles between three noise cancelling levels: 0 for none, 5 for medium, 10 for maximum. These levels can be customized with the Boss App. A better interface would have been a rocker control. In fact, there should have been two rocker controls: one for noise canceling levels on the left speaker that says the number as it goes through them, and one on the right speaker for volume that just beeps.And now for the bad part. The right speaker also acts as a touch surface for gestures to do a few critical things. To toggle between pausing or playing, double tap the surface. This feels like you are hammering your eardrum and is quite loud. To go back or forward a track swipe forwards or backwards. This is awkward and unreliable. To raise or lower the volume swipe up or down. This is also awkward and unreliable, and also imprecise.A better interface for these controls would have been to use a rocker as described previously for the volume and a three pushbutton array for prior-track, pause/play, next-track. All together, that’s just 4 control areas, two per speaker, that can be found by feel and muscle memory and provide tactile feedback. Such an interface would be far more comfortable, intuitive, and easy to use than the gimmicky touch interface.",12/2/2020,AE3LTKGZ7X5FKCV6SBMV7ZCYJEAQ,1,0,Color: Black

441,R3KKF9VY8LXJOU,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Buggy software and buggy hardware,Inderjit Jutla,3,"A lot of other reviews will tell you about the sound quality/build quality/etc. I generally agree with that, but I ran into a lot of bugs that I didn't see in a lot of reviews:Hardware Bugs:After about 2 months of using these headphones, they would randomly turn off and reboot in the middle of whatever I was doing. Whether it was just listening to music or in the middle of a call. Very frustrating. I contacted Bose about it and they did thankfully offered to replace them at no cost to me. That was nice but it did take 2 weeks of not having my headphones to get the new ones (since I had to ship mine back first).The 'self voice' feature is sometimes good but I noticed it can sometimes mistake outside noise for my voice. One example is when there was a guy water jet cleaning across the street. The sound of it was loudly fed into my headphones (which I assume is a bug in the self voice feature). Pretty disappointing to have your 'noise cancelling' headphones unnecessarily feed outside noise into your ears. I turned this feature off.A minor nitpick I have is that in quiet environments, I notice that the headphones, when set to '0' noise cancelling can actually be noticeably louder than not wearing the headphone at all. I thought this might be due to the 'self voice' feature but I still had the issue when self voice was turned off. I understand this from an engineering perspective but again, 'noise cancelling' headphones should not be LOUDER than with no headphones, regardless of the situation. This issue is mostly fixed if I always keep my headphones noise cancelling at '10'.Software Bugs:The app has a lot little bugs that are kind of annoying. On the galaxy s9, often the app will not see my headphones, even when they are actively playing audio from my phone. Restarting the app typically fixes this.During the initial device setup phase of the app, if my phone tries to automatically pair to these headphones (and I let it), it can sometimes confuse the app and the app will not let me set up the headphones. I have to play around with unpairing my headphones and trying again to make it work.Another annoying issue is that if I have '0' in my list of noise cancelling levels and I have the headphones remember my last noise cancelling level: When I first turn on my headphones, and it's set to '0', my first click of the left button on my headphones does nothing, my second click jumps straight to the 3rd option. E.g. if my noise cancelling levels are set to 0, 5, 10. The noise cancelling will start at 0, I click the button, it does nothing, I click the button again, it goes to '5'. And I have to cycle through 0 again to get to 10.Nitpick: the voice assistant on the headphones cuts the audio to the headphones. E.g. when I mute the headphones, it cuts off my audio for about a second when telling me it's muted. Same when I unmute the headphones. It does not do this if I have voice assistant turned off. (it will instead play a nice tone)Final thoughts:Overall the headphones are still good, you can look to other reviews for all the positive aspects of the sound, noise cancelling, and mic. But these issues tell me Bose did a poor job of testing these headphones. If I only had 1 or 2 of the above issues, I would have given the headphones a 9/10, but with all these issues, I can't give the headphones more than 7/10, especially for $350.

I mostly use them as a wireless gaming headset instead of outdoor use, but so far the quality has not been lacking at all. The noise cancellation is almost too good where at times i cant even hear what is going on in the background; thankfully you can adjust the noise cancellation. The wireless range for them work very well just as long as you dont go too many rooms away. I have yet to test out the quality while wired, but will probably get the opportunity to test this out in the coming days. The bass seems kind of off through from the times i have used it to listen to music, but does not bother me too much. Would definitely recommend these headphones for anyone who has some money to spare and is looking for something that is of good quality audio.",10/29/2023,AHMPAZT7S2WIGCRRROXZ4GPHHUDA,1,0,Color: Black

I would not recommend replacing the battery, if you can find one. So the question you should ask i how many recharge cycles can I expect. I estimate I have had about 1000. Maybe I was lucky.

Or they are unintuitive. It took several tries to get the headset to stop looking for the same device - which I turned off bluetooth on so I could keep in pairing mode.

446,R1VQKMTI6I5RRC,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Bad Not Great,Jason L Fairweather,3,"My dog ate my navy blue Beats Solo Pro headphones that I had for years. I can’t find them anywhere now to purchase new. So, after researching a bit, I decided on these Bose headphones.They are an aesthetically pleasing design, over-the-ear, not on the ear. They are much more comfortable to sleep in than my Beats were. I can fall asleep and wake up hours later in the night to pee, not because my ears are sore.Being over-the-ear, they are very comfortable headphones. I traveled a lot with my Beats and wore them for hours on end at a time. Sometimes my ears would get a little sore or hot after hours of use.They do not cancel noise nearly as well as my Beats did. A substantial amount of noise gets through, even on the highest setting. My Beats were like noise deprivation headphones. Very solid noise cancellation.The buttons are placed in super inconvenient locations, so that when you grab your headphones to adjust them, you will definitely hit those buttons.The swipe feature on the headphones is a nice touch, and I like it. You can swipe for volume or track skips.They come in a hard case, which would be kind of nice, except today is December 2nd, and I bought these new and have had them since October 30th, and the zipper on the case has broken already, rendering the case completely useless. The case lasted less than a month.Overall, these headphones aren’t bad. But I might consider returning them and just trying to find something more comparable to my old Beats Solo Pros. Had the case not broken almost immediately, I might be more inclined to keep them, but that was kind of like the last straw.Update 02/14/2024:I sold these and purchased a pair of Beats Solo Pros. The new owner loves them. I personally did not like them much.",12/2/2023,AHXAMKDQLWXKEBFUHSQPNFLWOYGA,1,0,Color: Black
447,R127X8IU9C9MGJ,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Noise Cancellation, a Must-Have for Travelers",C,5,"I have experienced several noise-canceling headphones over the years, but these Bose headphones have set a new standard for me. Their exceptional noise-canceling capability, especially noticeable during air travel, is simply outstanding.What truly impresses me is the difference in ambient noise levels when I wear these headphones. For example, it’s only when I remove them, to go to the restroom on a plane, that I realize just how loud a plane can be. It’s a serious game changer.Comfort is another aspect where these headphones excel. Long flights can be tiring, but with these headphones, comfort is never compromised. Plus, the inclusion of an audio jack alongside Bluetooth connectivity is a thoughtful touch. It allows me to easily switch from my Bluetooth devices (phone) to the airplane’s entertainment system, ensuring I can enjoy movies without any hassle.Durability is another strong suit. After several years of use, they still perform like new. This quality so impressed my partner that we ended up purchasing a second pair. This speaks volumes about the product’s reliability and value. No pun intended.In summary, if you’re looking for a pair of noise-canceling headphones that offer superior sound isolation, comfort, and versatility, then look no further.

448,RKV8D2RZPMPJ9,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Product...but takes some work to connect to Windows Laptop,E. Dirst,4,"Pros:1. Best case for carrying headphones of any I've ever bought (I've owned 4+ different other brands). Perfect for traveling business person.2. Good fit and I can easily wear all day in comfort. I'd imagine they get hot if outdoors, but that's true of all headphones that are over-ear and have ear-cups that fit to head for better noise cancelation.3. Excellent voice controls...tells you battery life when turn on, and tells you what 2 devices you are connected to. Also has Alexa which I like because I just say ""Alexa, play Sirius XM Turbo"" and it starts playing that Sirius station. Can use any Alexa type question. This is optional so you don't have to use. You can also use Google Voice and Siri if you prefer.4. Excellent looking and nice finger press gestures on headphone sides to control things like volume, or double tap to answer call, etc. Keeps the buttons to very minimum which is great for looks and less things to break.5. Love that I can connect to both iPhone and Laptop for zoom/teams calls at same time. I often do a zoom call, then end it, start playing music from phone, then answer call...all with headphones.6. Music sounds much better on these than my Apple airpods (both old ones and new Pro ones). Much better bass for sure.Cons1. You do need the mobile app to easily setup. It will automatically download updates and install, but it doesn't notify you it's doing in background, so when you initially try to connect to Windows 10 it doesn't work because there are patches in firmware that allow it to work. Took about 30 minutes for new firmware to install in background and then worked fine.2. Sometimes Windows 10 won't find your Bose headphones when connecting via bluetooth the first time. Make sure to turn bluetooth on/off multiple times on windows 10 until it shows up. It eventually does. I think this is a Windows 10 problem because it showed up fine when connecting to iPhone.Hopefully they work/stay working for at least 2+ years...all my other headphones have broken after just 1 year, mainly because I travel a ton between customer sights, offices, and planes. I'm hoping the really good case the Bose headphones have keeps everything working well for multiple years. They certainly feel more solid and durable than other headphones I've utilized.",08/20/2021,AF4PBWTJA2N4LEME4FVXXOKC36KA,1,2,Color: Black
449,RLMQBUKEYVW5K,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is Good, Build Questionable",Trent,3,"For starters, I’m not really going to review the sound quality, because in short they sound like a $300 pair of headphones. You can tweak the settings and make a custom EQ in the Bose Music app, so you can make it what you will. I listen to a lot of jazz, instrumental, metal, and I’m satisfied.My main issues are with this current generation of ANC and the build quality on the Bose 700’s.ANC: On one hand, it’s good. In certain environments I feel like I’m in a bubble and I can’t hear the world beyond. It’s perfect, just my music. In others, I can hear more than I would like. We’re talking, literally, I can listen to classical symphonic music on a lawn mower at a decent volume and hear the dynamics. It’s fantastic. There, I’m truly impressed. However at work, I sit at a desk and there’s machinery some 300 feet away. Drill press, a saw, and chiefly a large fan that’s always on for ventilation. It is loud, yes, but I also get the sense even on the highest setting, ANC isn’t fully engaged. I think this because I’ve ever had the 700’s on and sneezed, dropped something, or otherwise had a sudden loud noise nearby and I can feel what’s like a diaphragm move. Pressure changes in the cup, and momentarily that super loud sound is muted greater than the atmospheric noises. E.G. an alarm goes off at work and each individual tone going off results in a higher noise cancellation sensation. When I have ANC maxed out, I want it truly maxed out, not on an algorithm. You can already adjust what level you want ANC on, so I see no benefit to this feature. If I want to be deaf to the world, considering the original MSRP, I better be. If anything else it’s very jarring to hear the accompanying “popping” that occurs with the added acute noise cancellation.Build quality: See picture…I’ve had these three months, have only worn them daily for two weeks as a test and the stainless steel frame has scratches from the ear cups. Also, every time I turn my head, a wonderful rubbing sound of the ear cup turning. In this department I am a bit of a snob. I typically don’t buy headphones that make a lot of frictional noise. As in I’ll literally jiggle display pairs of headphones to see if I can hear the plastic on plastic rubbing sound cheap pairs are plagued by. Anytime I’ve worn them outside I’ve wiped them off with a microfiber cloth and exclusively store them in the case. Aside from the vibrations from the aforementioned lawnmower, I have babied these due to the price. Hearing a plasticky popping sound whenever I turn my head, chew, adjust my glasses, is not something I expected from headphones marketed as having a stainless frame. This alone makes me wish I would have bought the Sony MK4’s.",10/12/2022,AHNFTZAN2B3J2EL5L63LKPHKSEJQ,1,3,Color: Black

Only complaint is that the earmuffs fold outward which when wearing gives the slight sensation like they aren't pushed against you in the front.

453,R32CKBN0I3XEPG,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Update,"H, Phillips",5,"I hope my review did not dissuade anyone from trying these phones. I did successfully connect them via wire to my MP3 player and the difference was startling. The music was bright and the sound stage was full range. However, used with the wired connection, the Bluetooth slide, touch and tap functions did not work.What I realize now is that I didn’t give these Bose phones a long enough trial period. After listening via cable, I went back to try again with the Bluetooth. I must have had something hooked up wrong because this time after listening for several hours to a variety of music my experience has done a complete 180. I will definitely keep these phones. ********Yes or No? This noise-suppressing headset replaces my previous wired Bose that I either misplaced or someone in the gym walked off with—I suspect the latter.This Bose is quite different from my earlier BOSE headset. For starters, this one is Bluetooth and it creates a problem I hadn’t anticipated. The BT interferes with my hearing aids. My original QC35 had bright, full smooth sound with or without my hearing aids.By contrast, the sound of my new 700 is not a bright sound; though the stereo spread is good, the overall sound is muffled and the bass does not seem as realistic. Is that related to the Bluetooth function? The 700 can be used as a wired connection; but so far, I can’t get that connection to work.My previous QC headset did not have its own volume control; I had to adjust volume and other functions from my MP3 player; the new 700 phones do have their own volume control plus slide, touch or tap functions; though convenient, there is a learning curve to avoid pause, next or previous song and a bit of frustration when I can’t quite position my finger in the right place. Finding the right place quickly is often unsafe when I need to remove my hand from a bicycle or elliptical machine.The 700 has other functions as well that work in combination with Bluetooth cell phones; but I can’t speak on behalf of those controls as yet. I have Google Assistant, but not Alexa.My primary purpose in buying over-the-ear headphones is noise suppression, specifically for use in the gym. Though the QC’s were excellent— especially to cancel out the constant drone of an airplane engine; the 700 is spectacular in various locations and can be tuned to different levels of noise suppression.Return? Or Not? That’s going to be a tough decision. But I really do prefer a brighter sound with body-shaking, yet realistic bass.",10/3/2020,AHGKWGJ5MBNJF27TPDBRCWAMN5JQ,1,1,Color: Silver Luxe

I don't like to write long reviews, so I'll make it short. Here's my opinion- Excellent sound quality, and noise cancellation. I use this headphones all the time, at work (meetings), in home(movies), while traveling(music). Just everywhere.- Battery life is around 15-20 hrs, which is descent. Could have been a bit longer.- Charging is quick.- I have 3 device profile saved in headphones. But, at any given time only 2 device can be connected. For eg., say my phone and my laptop. But, sound can be played from only 1 device at a time. Meaning, I need to pause audio in one device, in order to play audio on other device, but do not have to go through hassle of disconnecting one device, and connecting other.- A 2.5 to 3.5 connector is included with the product, but it's length is very short. You might need to get a longer cable. Meaning, you can play audio even if your battery is dead, but sound quality falls drastically.- Once in a while, I will have issues pairing my devices. Not too often. But, I can live with it.- I usually prefer to wear my headphones for an extended period of time, i.e., 4-6 hours, or more even. These headphones feel comfortable initially for around 2-2.5 hr, but after that heads start hurting because these headphones do have very strong clamping force (which explains the exceptional noise cancelling).- Would I prefer Sony WH series over these? If I need more battery life, and more comfortable wearing for extended time, YES. For sound quality, and noise cancellation (NO).",03/3/2023,AFBLW453P2J7MCXHYZ4SSV6QNKHQ,1,9,Color: Black

Whether I was in a noisy coffee shop or on a bustling city street or a noisy gym, the headphones effectively blocked out the external sounds, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or audiobook.One of the standout features for me was how easy it was to connect and switch between devices. With just a few taps on my phone, I could seamlessly switch from my laptop to my tablet without any hassle. It made my multitasking life much more convenient.As for the sound quality, I found it to be more than satisfactory. While I'm not an audiophile myself and primarily listen to classical or soft soundtracks, the headphones delivered clear and balanced audio. The melodies and instruments were rendered beautifully, capturing the nuances of the music.I came across some reviews mentioning that the accompanying app required location access, but I found this to be untrue in my experience. I was able to connect and play my music without being prompted to share my location. This was a relief for me, as privacy is important, and I appreciate that the headphones respected that.In conclusion, these headphones offer outstanding noise cancellation, easy device connectivity, and enjoyable sound quality.

458,R2A7ROA8UQKRVG,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great ANC, Bad Battery Life, Limited Performing Voice Calling",Donny,3,"I've owned the Bose QC35 ii for three years now and I can say they are the BEST ANC headphones and have the BEST USER EXPERIENCE, not so good on voice pick up during calls in noisy environments. I'm in the consumer device tech industry and travel for business often, and have been looking in the market for headphones that have good ANC and also have good voice pick up for calls. I was ecstatic when Bose came out with the NC700, having both ANC + voice pick up. As expected, they have great ANC and great listening quality, just as good, if not better, as the QC35s. Beyond that, my experience starts to drop. I did my first conference call with the NC700 in the car on the freeway going to airport, and the voice pick up FAILED. The experience started out great, my colleagues would hear me clearly with no issue, with reduce noise background and clear voice quality. It seemed the NC700 was doing well with the voice pick up. Then all of sudden, intermittently, my voice volume would reduce during the call to the point my colleagues could not hear me or any of the background noise. I can see my input voice volume level monitor from my app and it would notice it reduce to zero. Then after 20-30 seconds later, my voice would pick back up again and my colleagues can hear me loud and clear. This happened a few times during the conference call to the point that I just stopped using the head-set and started using my phone's microphone. Very embarrassing when your coworkers are saying, ""we can't hear you!"" and you've been talking for the last few minutes. Since then, I've tested the NC700's voice pick up quality in different environments, with different apps, PC vs Phone, and results are mixed but more on the failing side. The voice pick up failure happens on any device, with any app. Sometimes it works, most cases it doesn't. Sometimes I can go through a 30 minutes conference call at the airport with no voice pick up issues. Then most times in descent noisy areas, it would just fail within minutes, and I would have to revert to my phone. In a quite room or area, works great! In addition to the voice pick up fail, the battery life sucks! After a full charge, it would say 18 hours of usage available. Within 2-3 hours of continuous use, it would say 10 hours of usage available. What happened to the 8 hours? Just recently, on a full charge, the headset lasted only 10 hours. My journey was business trip, 2 hours on the road, 6 hours on a plane, 2 hours waiting in lobbies, from leaving my place to getting to my destination. Fully charged when I left, dead on arrival at my destination. Oh yeah, almost forgot, the Bose App also sucks. I always have to reconnect my headset to the app in order for the app to recognize my headset. Also I have to keep logging back in, with user name and password, after I wake up the app. It doesn't like to keep my info or keep my logged in. In addition to the app experience, I always get this RED warning notification my headset isn't connected to WIFI. I'm not sure why I need Wifi to have this operate normally. Very annoying. I do have a wireless unlimited data plan. My wife has the same pair, but her voice pick up seems better. She uses to call me while she's on the bus and she's loud a clear the whole conversation. As for me, it cuts out. I'm returning NC700 and getting a replacement.",07/18/2019,AGJYFL2XXXPX2WTCZS4HPIKLRYLA,1,18,Color: Black

460,R22T3INHVMO8JR,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, but with problems...",Nigel Palmer,3,"Ever since the Bose QC 35 II headphones were released, I have been keeping an eye on the heavy hitters in the over-ear, noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones space. A year after the Bose 700 headphones were released, I finally purchased a pair, but was overall disappointed after using them for nearly a month (see below) and replaced them with the newer Sony WH-1000MX4 headphones.On to my experience with the Bose 700 headphones...PROS:- Look great/professional/sleek.- Noise cancellation performance is very good... I also like the shortcut buttons that allow you to change the levels.- Great voice pickup/clarity.- Clear overall audio/music sound quality, but with caveats (see below).- I like the smooth sliding mechanism for sizing.- Pretty comfortable and they don't get overly warm in the ear muffs... slightly more top pressure than I would like, but most folks probably won't have a problem.CONS:- Unstable firmware... as of this writing (Aug/Sep 2020), Bose prevented earlier firmwares (e.g. v1.31) from upgrading to the newer firmware version(s) with the sound equalizer feature due to widespread reports of battery issues and other problems. I thought my headphones were defective until I dug around various internet forums to finally find out what was going on. Firmware problems after over a year since release is not a good sign, and I expect that Bose will release a newer product to compete with Sony at this point before they ever fully fix the 700s.- Bluetooth issues... mine would occasionally cause audio distortion when paired with two devices at once (e.g. a PC and smartphone).- Power issues... mine would randomly shut off 1-2x per day, often in the middle of important conference calls.- Battery issues... I was getting at most around 14 hours of battery life despite mine being brand new. Granted your audio and noise cancellation settings can affect this, but still disappointing compared to the manufacturer-advertised 20 hours of battery life.- Sound quality, though overall very clear, is fairly low on bass and volume. I had to crank the volume up much higher compared to the newer Sony headphones to reach satisfying levels. I can't comment on the new equalizer feature to help the bass due to the firmware issues mentioned above.- Pressure... with noise cancellation on, my ears often felt like they were in a pressurized container which felt a little odd and uncomfortable. I don't notice this happening with other over-ear noise cancellation headphones.- Bulky... these don't fold at all so the case is a little big considering that many users will want these for travel.- The 2.5mm headphone port for occasional wired use is a little inconvenient (even considering the included cable) compared to Sony's 3.5mm port where I can use other cables that I already have.- No airline wired adapter included... not a deal-breaker these days, but other manufacturers still include one.- The MSRP is a little high considering heavy competition from less expensive/arguably better/newer headphones like the Sony WH-1000MX4s. However, I will note that these can be found on sale for a quite a bit lower than the MSRP and often cheaper than the newest Sony model.The verdict... these cost too much to have to deal with firmware problems/delays, Bluetooth issues, and poor battery life. Maybe mine were defective after all. In any case, I returned these and bought the newer Sony WH-1000MX4 headphones instead, and so far they do not have the problems that I discussed here.",09/1/2020,AFBPJIJSGK63NDJOLKOZ2A4OGVBQ,1,12,Color: Black

I’m an audio quality snob, and before these headphones, audio quality has always taken precedence over any and every part of the headphones. NO MORE. I WAS WRONG. I've had them just under a year, and (UNFORTUNATELY) have used them almost every single day of that.

And the auto-off setting they have DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY. It’s very inconsistent, so there’s no guarantee your headphones aren’t on all night.2. They eat hair. Not just sometimes- MOST of the time. I wear them every single day, and I lose hair to them every single day.3. They WILL slip and fall off of your head. No, you don’t have to be doing anything extreme. Bend over, there go your headphones. And if you care about your skin, like me, trust me when I say that the band across the top that sits on your hair all the time WILL find its way onto your forehead far too often.4. The mic is garbage unless you have the aux plugged in. If you’re using bluetooth, it will sound like you’re in a cave in space, 20 feet away from the microphone. There hasn’t been a single time I answered a call with these headphones (with no aux) and the person asked where the **** I am because the sound and quality are so ridiculous.5. They will not turn off if they’re not connected to anything. Once or twice I’ve made the mistake of thinking, well turning them off doesn’t work, maybe if they can’t connect to anything then they’ll shut off after a while. NOPE, they just stay on until they die. As I mentioned, there’s a setting you can change to make them turn off after a period of inactivity. Apparently that doesn’t count as inactivity. Know what does?6. Turning on the hear-through function. That counts as inactivity. I have my headphones set to turn off after five minutes of inactivity. (This is hit or miss to start with.) For the hear-through function, if your headphones are on, connected to something, actively playing something, or playing something but you paused it, and you hit the hear-through function, you’ll be able to hear through the headphones like they’re not there... until the auto-off function kicks in, because apparently walking around on your head with a specific function turned on isn’t enough activity. They will turn off. If you had something playing, then the experience will go like this- you’re focused on whatever it is that you turned hear-through on for, when suddenly the hear-through stops, the noise-cancelling turns on, whatever you had playing before turns back on for just a few seconds, then the headphones play their turning-off tone and turn off. Why? Is this a bug? No one could have purposefully decided to make them do this, right?7. They beep before every audio message!! Actually, it’s not even before, it’s at the start of every audio message. The beep PLAYS OVER THE BEGINNING of every audio message. Got a message that’s 5 seconds long? Too bad! Better disconnect your headphones!8. Ohhh so you had to turn your bluetooth off because they kept turning back on for no reason? Well, when you turn your bluetooth back on, they won’t connect automatically, you’ll have to go into your settings to connect to the demon headphones again.9. Using the aux cord disables the touch controls. You'll have to take your phone out the skip forward or backwards.10. If you lose the aux, rest assured you don't have a spare laying around. It's a 2.5mm - 3.5mm aux. One side, the one that goes into the headphones, is much smaller than normal.These things.... do not buy these things. THEY'RE NOT WORTH IT.",01/15/2022,AFDSUWAATFQ6KQM4UI2EMLZ4PGEQ,1,82,Color: Black
464,R2E2ZW62W159BO,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars How do I use this?,Reclusive Hermit,4,"Generally very happy with my headphones. The sound cancelation works very well. The battery lasts a long time. If the battery starts to go on me, then I have been at the computer too long!There is a button that can adjust the amount of sound cancelation from 10 which blocks virtually all constant noise, 5 which i suspect is just the headphones physically blocking sound, to 0 where the headphones transmit ambient sounds to my ears. It ever so slightly enhances my hearing. Like, set to 0, I can faintly hear the rain outside/on the roof, but if I remove them, I can't hear it anymore.There are two modes on the headphones, ""headphones"" and ""headset."" Headphones is just for listening and is better sound quality, headset uses a speaker so you can talk to people. For PC users, you can adjust which one you use the same place you can adjust the volume. There's a drop down list of outputs above the volume slider.In spite of everything I have figured out about this headphones, It has getures, I know it does because I have accidentally tapped the side of the headphones and it would pause. I can't purposely replicate it because I have no idea what I did. Would be nice if it gave some instruction for this feature.",03/27/2023,AFIMNDXQL2TIMBTPUYKFFLXYD3AA,1,4,Color: Black

I’ve always relied on Apple’s in-ear pods, but their battery life is short compared to Bose (3+ hours vs 18 hours), and I have trouble getting the in-ear ones to stay put. I don’t use the headphones when I’m out and about, but then I don’t use the in-ear pods unless I’m home because they tend to fall out of my smallish ears. Which is to say I use both.

467,R2GXENUNGQ1HCC,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: NOW SERIOUS QC ISSUES,Eric K.,1,"MAJOR QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES: I liked the Black ones so much I bought a Silver pair. They've *both* started to malfunction in a dramatic way: Sudden, painful screeching feedback while using, akin to what happens when you hold a microphone up to the speaker. For this problem to appear with both headsets, in a similar timeframe, suggests that something is seriously wrong here. Maybe it was a software update? Warning folks: These are now officially a Beta release, and this is coming from a HUGE Bose fan.UPDATE: So my second pair of NC700's came and it functioned flawlessly. I like it so much I bought a second pair in silver. However, I have a new beef with Bose, and new users should be warned:YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP WITH A BOSE ACCOUNT JUST TO USE THE FEATURES ON THIS HEADSET, AND THE APP ROUTINELY MALFUNCTIONS IN WAYS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM USING ALL FEATURES. GOD HELP YOU IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR SETTINGS AND YOU CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNET TO LOG IN.(1) Dear Bose, maybe some McKinsey or BCG consultants (or worse, your own internal strategy team) told you that you need to be a content company. Thus, you must 'own' your users, so they are captive in your ecosystem. I think you should focus on hardware, but TO REQUIRE users to have an account with you just to use a pair of headphones? That is unacceptable, and in really bad faith. I know the response (I work in this world): We need to store user information to enhance the user experience, by enabling us to store logins with streaming services and digital assistants. It's a security issue. Agreed, BUT nothing about that should stop you from letting us OPT OUT and just use the headphone in 'headphone mode', and still be able to change our settings, deactivate voice prompts, etc., without logging in. Nothing about that functionality requires an account with Bose, or a login. We both know that, Bose and I, because the app for the QC35ii's did not require it.(2) To add injury to insult (yes, that's what I mean), the app does not work.(a) It routinely logs me out so I have to type my login and password (if I can remember it, I have so many) on my tiny little phone keyboard so I can stop the automatic shut-down tones from waking me up in the middle of my flight to Heathrow - wait, I CAN'T log in, because I have no internet connection. I'm 36,000 feet up over Newfoundland. So much for using my $400 headphones to get a good nights sleep on my way to London. You know a lot of your users use these things on planes, right?(b) Even when I can login, it routinely fails to find the headphones, despite the fact that my iPhone X itself can quickly connect, disconnect, and reconnect to them via Bluetooth.C'mon Bose, don't abuse your loyal fans with this kind of thing. Give us an app that can handle all functionality that doesn't require partner logins (Spotify, Alexa) without logging in. Options like: ""Log in to access personalized services"" or ""Just use my $400 headphones, please"".-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am a huge Bose fan - I own 4 pairs of QC35ii's. I received this pair one week from the release date, and they are defective out of the box. Erratic low frequency pulsing from right ear, not fixed by reboot or other technical support remedy. I've already ordered my next pair, but seriously, Bose? It's a $400 pair of headphones. There is no excuse for poor quality in a new release. Pay careful attention to your purchase, folks, this defect was subtle but unmistakable.",07/8/2019,AFFOF6WLKYGCEPLBA7TBCKY5BYMA,1,672,Color: Black

469,RE2CWHT5X96X7,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Connection & comfort issues but great noise cancellation & classic Bose sound,Tink,3,"I LOVE my Bose QC headphones but they are really starting to see some age and they’re starting to lose the charge much quicker and I knew it was time to start looking to upgrade my headphones. I wear them every day for hours and use them for multiple purposes. Naturally I thought to upgrade to the newest set of Bose ANC headphones.I purchased and immediately I had all kinds of issues in setup with connecting them to my phone. I was surprised that you have to download an application, etc but that was ok and all but the app had all kinds of issues connecting to the headphones.My first two days with my headphones, I spent about 6 hrs+ on forums, etc. trying to go through various resets, steps to get them up and running. It was very frustrating. I have to say that after that first two days and all those steps I no longer had connection issues so something I finally did must have worked. But to me, paying this kind of money and having to ‘work’ that hard to connect them is really unacceptable.I also felt that coming out of the box and putting them on, the headphones were VERY snug/tight on my head and ears.I understand that you need a snug fit to get great noise cancellation but these were extremely snug on my head. I tried to adjust them up/down, etc. and still felt they were just WAY too tight.I thought maybe there was a ‘break-in’ period so I gave it a few weeks and they just never lost that extremely tight/snug fit and that ‘pressure’ on my ears and scalp.It was just too painful for me and was causing me to get migraines. I admit that I am prone to migraines and I’m overly sensitive to any type of pressure on my head/temples, etc. so this was a no go for me. I want to note that I don’t have this issue with my QC headphones though. They fit snug but not overly so.I also noted that the ear cups/pads were thinner? And this did not help alleviate that pressure. I could feel the ear cup (plastic part of the cup) pushing against my ear instead of the nice soft foam.I think many others may not have these issues and all these issues are just a ‘fit’ issue for me but these just did not fit / work for me and I was really disappointed because I love my Bose QC so much!I might perhaps just try to upgrade to the QC 2 headphones as I’ve heard they are almost identical to the original.I want to say a big thank you to the returns for making it so easy to return my order. It was super easy and quick. No questions asked and I really appreciate that! Thank you.I am giving 3 stars overall because honestly, Bose are awesome and I think this was just a personal ‘fit/comfort’ issue and they were great with my return.

472,R33YZOC4IHRZTT,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Good but not great - prefer QC35 for mute functionality,Travis Cornwell,3,"Loved the QC 35's and was looking for an upgrade that could function for work at home purposes + a casual gamer (5-10 hours per week). Several flaws made me want to return:- Biggest flaw - mute button does not work as advertised with PCs. Great for phone, horrible for PC. There is an alternative available - NC 700's with the Bose Link. On Amazon, you need a business account for that - and even then - reviews of that are mixed for effectiveness of mute function.- No option to switch to a wired microphone. QC35 has the Gaming edition and there are plenty of third party accessories for regular QC35 to convert it to a wired setup. Why a wired microphone? Mute button that works flawlessly with any PC connection. For meetings where I'm speaking frequently, go wired so can mute/unmute easily. For meetings where I'm muted most of the time - go with the wireless headset. QC35 with a wired connection disables bluetooth, but has full noise cancellation in effect - solid win here.- Comfort level isn't quite the same as QC35. As several have described there's more of a clamping force at play vs. a soft cushiony approach.- Can only connect two devices at once. Same as the QC35's - but given the upgrade I would have expected more out of the software. i.e. Let me prioritize which devices I want connected. i.e. Leave my phone connected at all times, but if my work laptop is on, choose it over my personal desktop.- Bass isn't as good as QC 35's. Playing Prodigy's Smack my ___ Up at the 50 second mark when the bass kicks in, there's a clear winner.- Putting in the case you have to collapse the extendible part of the earphones. Then when you pull back out, you have to readjust to the appropriate length. A slightly larger case would have solved this easily. With the QC35s, you leave it extended and fold the headphones, comes out correct length every time.- Can't charge while in the case - I have Jabra Elites for exercise purposes at a much lower price point which can do this. Technology is there, just not implemented.- (Personal preference) - I prefer the tactile feedback of the QC35's when I press the buttons vs the NC700's tapping/sliding/etc.Now for the positive's above the QC35- Much better bluetooth connectivity. Never had a disconnect. With the QC35's, I've had to flip off then back on once or twice during a workday because they randomly lose connectivity.- Noise cancellation. QC35's are good but even at the ""High"" level I can hear outside noises seeping through. NC700's at highest levels block just about everything.- Better battery life.",09/1/2021,AEJUO2XJYKKCCFDWRRXSELDOXT2Q,1,0,Color: Black

474,R3K4O8K9K4UBV5,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars By far the best work from home, video conference headphones currently on the market",andrew wright,5,"TLDR - buy these for work from home. The noise cancelling mic is amazing, as is the noise cancelling in the headphones.I don't often write reviews but I feel compelled to help others make an easy decision that I agonized over for too long. Like many, I'm working from home and on Teams/Zoom calls all day. My kids are also home for summer. To cap it off, we're having some construction work done in the space I work. I've had some other less expensive noise canceling headphones for a while and they clearly weren't keeping up.The Bose set was undeniably going to be the best noise cancelling set to listen to. My big question was mic quality and background noise suppression. If you're reading this, you've probably read a million reviews over the last couple years about the mic being the major failing of all these sets for work from home folks.I've had these for a month now and my coworkers couldn't hear a belt sander going all day 15ft from me for days. The mic is amazing at cancelling noise. Of course, the noise cancellation in the headphones is stellar as well.As others have said, these are not the best on earth for full range, deep, powerful base reproduction when listening to music - I'm sure thats due to how low profile the cups are leaving less room for drivers. What you get in return is a headset thats much lighter than they look and are very comfortable to wear for 10hrs a day.The noise cancelling does chew through batteries. They're good for about two days per charge but I charge mine at the end of every day out of habit now.",06/28/2022,AFOAWGVRPJVGSUJ22JAITMY5ZLCA,1,4,Color: Black
475,R27T7OEGC1ZK42,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Good enough,Erin McCole Cupp,4,"I needed over-the-ear headphones due to some ear and hearing issues, and I needed them to include the best possible mic I could afford. I did not want noise cancelling because my hearing is troublesome at best, and I actually wanted to be able to maintain contact with the outside world. Bear these things in mind when reading the rest.The mic is adequate. I honestly expected better, given the price, but it's better than what I had before, so... good enough. Same with the sound quality being ""good enough"" but not what I expected, given the price (though I write that with the caveat above that my hearing is not the best to begin with, so take this with whatever grain of salt suits your needs best).As for comfort, they are light and not too pinchy on the ears, but they are ***warm***, and I say this as your typical middle-aged woman who is always cold and is writing this review in the winter.Pairing to my phone is quick and seamless. Pairing to my laptop is hit-or-miss: again, I expected better performance for the cost.I don't know if I'd buy these again, but I'm hoping I won't have to buy anything to replace them any time soon, because this is the most expensive thing I've ever put on my ears.

476,RFQ0HD4PHE9I8,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars WORTHWHILE UPGRADE IF YOU’RE COMING FROM THE QC35’s (Maybe not the QC35 II’s?),Chris_Dobz,4,"So I have to disagree with the other reviewer that mentioned something about a mandatory app in order to use the headphones since I was immediately able to pair them with my Fire TV Stick 4K and use all the basic functions sans ‘voice assistant’ button. Everything else worked as it should including volume and the left ear button went from full NC to half to off and the long press went to “listen mode” and paused my show I happened to be watching. However, it’s true that you need the app to update firmware and assign the voice assistant (Siri was the default but most likely cause I have an iPhone XS Max).Anyway, I will say that I’ve had/used them for one day so far so my review is more of an “initial impression” and I’ll update it down the road with more use. That said my initial impressions are they are a worthwhile investment if you own the original QC35’s in that they offer a lot more in the way of creature features.Pros:- Active NC is impressive!- Voice Assistant is AWESOME (I’m using Google Assistant but it works great so far).- The have a “conversation button” (not the technical term) on the left ear is worth it’s weight in gold.- Although not rated for any moisture protection the headband material seems like it’ll hold up better in a gym type situation.- FINALLY AMAZING CALL QUALITY!!!!- Sound Quality is on par with the QC35’s so I’m suppose that’s a “pro” in my book.Cons:- Initially not a fan of the “clamp” style but I seemed to get used to it as the day went on but I have a smaller head.- Price!- Didn’t come with a USB adapter....Really Bose?Unknowns:- Battery Life- Bose AR...?- Not sure how I feel about the capacitive touch pad for volume control yet.Final Thoughts:If own the original QC35’s and have always wished you could use them to make calls without everyone on the line being able to hear your in a coffee shop and have always desired the QC35 II’s voice assistant feature then I would at this point recommend pulling the trigger on these bad boys!",07/15/2019,AHUTIJS6E4SA3G7HZP5OG2H67CUQ,1,4,Color: Black
477,R336ZWNSXOHHAX,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive... purchased for noise cancelation feature.,Virty,4,"I'm happy with this purchase. Are they perfect? No. I'm no audio snob and I certainly don't know much about the terminology or specs. I mainly bought these to listen to podcasts, *gasps*, yep. Specifically I was on the hunt for headphones that had enough noise cancelation and good ear cups so that I could listen to my favorite hosts talk (without background audio, just talk) without hearing my boyfriend's words while he talks with friends a few feet away. I took the plunge and made the investment after many reccomendations and reading reviews. After testing them out I'm fairly happy to report that these will work for me. I can hear my bf's voice but not his words, so I am able to focus on the podcasts!Headphones are comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. The battery life could be better especially for the price. Wish they included a longer charging cable and actual charger in the base package. Charging time seems to be less than 2 hours. The touch controls are fine. The auto off function is handy. Bose app is kinda neat. The microphone function is very nice and I can answer calls easily.Oh... and music is a delight with these.I can't speak for durability or longevity yet.Hope this helps someone out there make their decision one way or the other.",02/19/2023,AGLQY2NKMR64MRL6F5QUOKZAD67Q,1,11,Color: Black

They are comfortable despite my big ears (which are problematic for many headsets.) Comfortable enough that once I forgot I had them on.

The sound is perfect, hardly worth mentioning, this is Bose, you get perfect noise cancelling with Bose, this is no exception. What matters is the MIC quality, now this one does not have an external MIC, which concerned me a little, but it has the MIC built into the headset, the sound quality is perfect, people who hear me can't quite believe it. The echo/noise cancelling is first rate, the MIC does not pick up people sitting right next to me talking to me. Finally the battery life is long, I just use it for a few days at a time, before charging, its quick to charge, only thing I dont like is that it will just turn off when the battery is spent, it does warn you at 10%, but then just off.

481,R34426OOIPP9WK,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones -- terrible integration,Chris M.,3,"I'd like to start off with... I am not an audiophile and did not purchase these headphones for music playback in super High Def. I did buy these based off of the YouTuber Mark Rober's recommendation because of the promised noise cancellation quality of both the microphone and speakers. That is 100% on point. I attend video meetings all day long while my kids are being loud, the vacuum is running, my overhead ceiling fan is on, and other household noises. These things are kings of the crop. And, I will say that even though I'm not an audiophile, these headphones sound amazing. Bose is again showing it's leadership in the world of affordable high quality sound engineering.I love the pass through from the mic to my ears so that I can but do not have to let the household noises in. e.g. If my kid wants to talk, but I'm in a meeting. I can turn on the conversation mode, mute my audio, and tell him that he still can't have a cookie for breakfast. Awesome.Cons: Bose is not a software company, and it shows in these headphones. Integration with Alexa is spotty at best as you need to have your iPhone Alexa app open in the background most of the time, but sometimes it works without that need, and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Do not rely on this feature, but it's a nice bonus when it does work.Conversation mode is not what I would call consistent. If I'm steaming from my phone with Apple Music or Pandora, then it works fine. If I am streaming any other content, the integration is inconsistent to the point where I can't rely on it. I find myself bringing my phone out, pausing the content, opening the Bose app, reducing noise cancellation to 0, and telling my wife ""Yes, chicken is ok for dinner the fourth night in a row, but by Friday I'm gonna need a steak"".The answering of phone calls or using the touch sensor is inconsistent. (Do you see a pattern here?). Sometimes I can answer a call, sometimes I can't. Really it seems that non music content is my major issue here. Periodically I have to answer the call on my phone, then tell the caller to hold off while I switch to a headset.Touch sensor works great for volume control, but again support for any playback ""buttonless"" functionality other than Music based apps only is clunky.Over all. Great headphones, but don't purchase for the ""super cool"" button-less interface. I'd actually just like some damned buttons and a consistent behavior from app to app (non-music :) )",09/8/2020,AEILS6BZKWXFXNMO4ABQMBBPSGMA,1,1,Color: Black

483,R1H6ZIUIF50FJK,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Update: Good noise cancelling.,Alice,4,"I use these headphones for the following: listening to music, tuning out a noisy environment, attending a live-online class. I have had these for almost two months and I LOVE them. I am a musician and thus, somewhat of an audiophile who appreciates refined, balanced sound. I do not care for a bass emphasis in my sound like some brands advertise. These headphones deliver high quality, balanced sound for my middle-aged ears, offer great connectivity and batteries hold their charge (20 hours). Connectivity is streamlined and quick with all my devices. I do not need to be connected to wi-fi for them to function; initially connecting via the Bose app was easy I was able to set them up quickly and Bose customer service was very quick to respond to a question I had during set-up. While I no longer use the Bose app, it was good to get them registered directly with Bose. The noise cancelling option offers 2 different levels (5 and 10)... 10 is amazing cancelling the majority of low-level, bass sounds in the environment. Sometimes I put on my favorite light music or nature sounds, close my eyes and give myself a break from everything. It's like being able to take a mini-vacation from the noise of everyday life. They are also very light-weight and don't squeeze my head like some headphones.Now only time will attest to their reliability/durability.(I look for long-lasting quality in technology, in this world where too much waste is produced).I bought these because I trust in Bose's history of quality and reliability. (Gratefully, I still have my Bose room CD-radio player which I bought 16 years ago). I will write another update in approximately a year. Hopefully, I can report that battery life is still going strong along with everything else.UPDATE 3/2020: They lose blue-tooth connectivity at 3 hours remaining battery-life. I'm pretty disappointed. I bought these for 399.00 and now they sell for 349.00. The ""new"" ones sell for 459.00 and come with a charging case, which is not available for separate purchase.UPDATE 7/2022: With firm updates, blue-tooth connectivity improved. They are really good noise cancelling headphones; I wear them everyday. My only wish is for longer battery life... at this point they charge to 18 hours, 2 hours less than when brand new.",02/27/2020,AHOE3XHJWJGKGB55I7GEVI5YOESQ,1,1,Color: Black
484,RKM2NFO0KBD6H,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars The Way Artists Intended To Be Heard,Heather Tietjen,5,"Right of the bat with the tamper evident label, elegant box, and leather carry case I was impressed! Impressed and eager. Bringing the headset to a full charge was a very lllloooonnnngggg two hours. I’m so glad I made this investment.Setup was quick and easy thanks to the Bose Music App that they direct you to download in the instruction manual. I’m ecstatic how custom you can set your sound, ie. Bass Boost, Treble Boost, Noise Cancelling (degree).I’ll be honest, what queued me to purchase this item was due to sweating out a more affordable brand. They just couldn’t handle a bucket of sweat and my friends referred me to the Bose 700. Friend referral plus Men’s Health Magazine “Editors Choice”, and I was convinced.You can hear SO many different harmonics! It almost feels like listening in a recording studio (I imagine). Each note is rich and full of life. The fit is exceptional (even over hair as advertised!).The highest water resistance, factory warranty, and Bose reputation are amazing.Day one of ownership: five star! I’m hopeful to feel that way in years to come.",09/2/2023,AE7FFNGZZE3LIUBJALPHLCGJYZ6Q,1,6,Color: Black
485,R1SD4ROL9AU71M,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose doesn't Disappoint,Aaron B.,5,"I love these headphones, I use them every single day and they have served me extremely well. I'm a college student and spend a lot of my time studying and listening to music. I live in a dorm and have three other roommates with desks within 5 feet of mine. Sitting and studying at my desk usually means that there is background conversation in the room or others playing music at a decent volume on their speakers. Putting these headphones on completely blocks that out. Turn noise cancellation up to ten and play music at about 50-70% volume and I can't hear a word of what anyone in the room is saying. They have started playing a game of how loud they have to say my name before I notice. They have to get very close to yelling occasionally when I am not paying attention and have the volume way up.As for the sound quality, I love it. I listen to everything from rap (heavy bass) to classical and orchestral pieces. I can confirm that the sound quality is consistent throughout genre, for some the bass may be slightly lacking but I find it to be more than enough.The Bose app is pretty much useless but it doesn't matter because all you need to do with it is set where you want your three noise cancelling levels to be and then never open the app again.The battery life is great I get the full 20 hours out of it even half a year later.One thing that I found surprisingly convenient is the included aux cord. Odd to purposely use Bluetooth headphones cabled I know but it does have its benefits. When travelling you can connect it to on board entertainment. And between when I got my Desktop computer and added bluetooth capability to it the aux cable came in handy.I love the case, granted it's slightly larger than the quiet comfort's but it's flatter which is nice. The hidden compartment is nice for housing the cables.Lastly is my only complaint about these headphones, I have a fairly large head already and big ears and yet these fit perfectly. That said the slides on either side that allow adjustability have become noticeably looser. They still work but it just means I have to readjust them to make them tighter about once every hour or two. No problem just a mild annoyance, hopefully they have fixed this in newer ones.",02/17/2020,AFGHFFTVEI37PQXTL7RRTFYHRMTQ,1,1,Color: Black
486,RQXCTQDBE882Y,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars They're nice but the features are no good.,M,3,"So, like you I went through the reviews before purchasing this and I thought that the negative reviews must be wrong and these headphones have 4 1/2 stars and should be great... But I was wrong and heres why:These are exactly how every negative review speaks about:1. They are uncomfortable (even after stretching them over a period of nights). The clamping force is really there and unless you have a small head, it's not gonna be a good time.2. Sound quality is fine if you're looking for a neutral sound, but things are gonna feel like 'blurry' or 'muggy' sounding. Even basic tv shows, music, etc. It just feels off you know.3. You can really only get the functionality out of these when using their app that they force on you, and even then Bluetooth fails to connect, or takes FOREVER (on either ios or android). Sometimes it'll only connect to bluetooth LE and just wont play any sounds at all or just straight up won't connect. Whatever this thing is feeling at that particular moment is what you get.4. Touch controls are a pain. The double tap to pause play works fine to pause but to play again I have to hit the side of these things with the force of 5 gorillas and the double tapping speed of a spacex rocket. It's very frustrating. It just won't play otherwise. Also the volume controlls have no incrimental feature, the volume will just go up in down in these large increments. And also my finger like really drags on the earcups, it's not a smooth feeling like you would think.5. Sometimes it will just cause my music or show to just stop playing entirely. Like just pauses it without warning6. OMG THE SOUNDS THIS THING MAKES. When you turn it on, turn it off, when its connecting to something or loses connection. ITS LOUD. it will wake you up if you are falling asleep or it will make you leap out of your chair when you aren't expecting it. Thing of the music that's playing for the suspense for a horror movie leading up to the jump scare and just about when the music cuts out for the scare, it goes from low volume to high really quickly and then all quiet till you poop your pants... Yeah, thats the sound this makes. And you can't change it.7. They're not all that.The good:Noise cancellation is great, and the look is very nice and clean. It's hard to beat, but I think quiet comfort 35s are better in overall comfortablity and use.If you don't mind being annoyed constantly, then get these, otherwise buy something else.I will be happily returning these.Thanks for reading",08/2/2020,AEZXUMY2MUUPRRR5XJMEDUV4JKOQ,1,0,Color: Black
487,R1AEU0JT4GMC4M,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Spencer O'Reilly,4,Fantastic build quality with a metal headband meaning it won't break from going from a cold room temperature extended use in a room with a hot running gaming computer (I don't understand how plastic headbands exist for more than $20). The audio quality is clear. They are fairly lightweight and balance the weight well between earcup pressure and the headband; resulting in a comfortable fit even if the cups are a bit shallow and my ears have to be tucked in just a bit to call these over-ear rather than on-ear headphones. They have rather strong active noise cancellation which is good because without them they have a pretty loud seashell effect. The battery only lasts me between .75 to 1.25 days of usage... So I just charge them everyday. If the battery lasted longer they'd be 5 stars for me.,05/1/2023,AFAWW6G645VJX3VJGOTV3L5SCTIA,1,2,Color: Black
488,R326KGXORRRLRX,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Would give 5 stars except for user interface and manual,Michael Whitlock,4,"Would give 5 stars for quality noise cancellation and sound quality, BUT-Manual only contains info on how to onboard with the App. It contains little information on how to operate the device-Too few buttons. They needlessly double up the functionality of unlabeled buttons, causing confusion and lengthening the learning curve of using what should be 100% intuitive-When muting and unmuting yourself, you are unable to hear anything through the headphones for a couple of seconds while a voice says ""Muting""/""Unmuting"". Causes issues during meetings. Mute isn't a toggle switch so you can't tell if you're muted or not until you press it.There really isn't more innovation to be had from a pair of wireless headphones. It's not a crime to have 6 or 7 buttons. They tried to bare bones the interface at the cost of usability.",07/17/2023,AG6AR7QO77RCOWJ7QGF6Y2HDLMGA,1,5,Color: Black
489,RY0WKNL6IN30S,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Quality,Taylor A.,4,I purchased these after I had so much trouble with the bears charging. Luckily these charge very well and gave a great battery life lasting me a full day. The mic quality is fantastic as people I talk to on the phone can now hear me over the tractor where other pairs of headphones they couldn’t. The connect to Bluetooth very easy and a pretty comfortable. They do make me sweat a little on hot days because of the foam ears. So far they seem durable but I will know for sure within a year.

490,R1MORHVZP62XOQ,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars (Bose NC 700) Great overall,Alex,4,"I've had these headphones for about a year anda half and they've lasted longer than most of my headphones have in the past so they're definitely durable. The noise cancellation is great, I love that you can control the level of noise cancellation either with a button on the headphones or from the Bose Music app. The button switches between 10 (initial nc level when turned on), 5, then 0 and the app lets you set the nc at any level you want. The earpads are comfortable and don't squeeze your head but they only last roughly 4-6 months before they need to be replaced. The only real thing to complain about is that wind makes it hard to hear what you're trying to listen to because the headphones use a mic to let you hear your surroundings and anything stronger than a strong breeze will interfere with what you're trying to listen to",05/26/2023,AGRQQEH574N3K6Q6CIE7BVZ23Q7A,1,5,Color: Black
491,R3JYWZSHYLD4FW,B07Q9MJKBV,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancelling-inconsistent BT and terrible app - cushion seams fail in 30 months,T. Scott,3,"Updated on 8/16/22After a little over 2.5 years of almost daily use, the cushion cover on the left ear has come apart. See photo.Original Review:I primarily use headphones to listen to TV after my wife goes to bed. I use the noise canceling to filter out the hum of the air purifier in the room. I replaced my Cowin E7 ANC headphones. The Cowin replaced ZV-750 earbuds. I pair these with a 2 year old Samsung UN43MU63OF UHD Smart TV.First, the sound quality and noise canceling features are what I expect. I especially like the fact that the bass is more subdued than many headphones. I'm 74 and I am totally over the need for pounding bass :-). I also have minor hearing loss so understanding dialogue can be a problem, but NOT with these headphones. Furthermore the noise canceling cancels the hum of the air purifier. I also like the Conversation Mode feature that can turn the noise canceling and audio off with the touch of a button, carry on a conversation and then switch it back on -- no need to take the headphones off. I am TOTALLY satisfied with the listening experience.I also like that it annonces the battery level when you turn the phones and announces the names of the devices it is connected with. It can connect to two devices as well, so you can answer your phone while watching TV. I have not tried that feature, however. I do not use Alexa or Google Assistant, so I cannot comment on those features.What I am frustrated with is the inconsistency I have with connecting to the TV. Now to be honest, I have had problems with the BT connection on this TV with the other devices. However, the Cowin E7 had much fewer problems than my ZV-750. The Bose has had the most problems. Furthermore it is also has to be re-paired frequently. Not what you expect from a Bose product. Sometimes I have to get and walk 6 feet and stand next to the TV for it to connect.The other frustration is that the Bose Music app for IOS that you use to connect and configure the headphones is piece of crap. I found it confusing the first time I used it to connect to the headphones, but then found that it does not reconnect to the headphones automatically. Fortunately, you don't need the app after you have the few options setup on the phone, such as the 3 different noise canceling levels that can be controlled by the button on the headset, which voice assistant you want to use and the auto power off.I'm keeping the headset because I don't need the app to what I need and BT issues are not critical.",04/22/2020,AERAPR2T7E2Z4ZUDLEKMXRZ5HASA,1,0,Color: Black
492,R13N500KHOPAFR,B07Q9MJKBV,"4.0 out of 5 stars High quality noise cancellation, and audio... when they're on!",Gabe I,4,"These are definitely quality headphones for phone calls and audio consumption, wired or wireless. I have used them wirelessly with a Pixel 3 XL and wired with an Oppo HA-2SE and NAD D7050.The noise cancellation is world class, as expected, and on par with the Sony WH1000XM3. The audio quality for music comes close to the Sony headphones, but only when the power is enabled and noise cancelling is on. If trying to listen to these passively when wired, the audio quality is very tinny and frankly unlistenable. However, once powered on with full (level 10) noise cancelling, these sound amazing.Microphone quality for phone calls is also amazing! Have not had any issues or complaints with the multiple conference calls I take for work. Living in NYC, I do not normally wear large headphones, especially noise cancelling, when walking in the street. Too many variables for potential injury.One specific con: The buttons are very easy to press when placing these on/picking them up from a desk. Particularly, the noise cancelling/ambient sound button, and the power button. The touch controls function well, but I have yet to see if they experience the phantom touches that plague the WH100XM3s in cold weather.When powering these on wired, they go through a series of start-up procedures. 1. The start up sound. 2. Battery life 3. Bluetooth connected or not. Essentially, these steps require 8 seconds before your music starts playing - unless you are listening passively with them off (not recommended due to the poor audio quality).Overall, phone calls are miles better than on the Sony WH1000XM3, however audio quality (and these do not support the same technology such as aptx) is not at the same level, unless they are powered on, which closes the gap substantially.If you are looking for a pair of headphones that is primarily used for phone calls and with a secondary purpose of music, these will fit the bill and then some. If you are strictly looking for noise cancelling headphones for music playback, then look towards the Sony WH1000XM3.",08/15/2019,AH2ZULPUIZ6G3WBVJHHGMQC7NIBQ,1,0,Color: Black
493,R32ZQK6N5X9L76,B07Q9MJKBV,"5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, reliable connection, great noise cancellation. Battery life could be better.",IanB,5,"I bought these to replace a working pair of Quiet Comfort 25's to avoid cord hassles while on conference calls. The Bluetooth connection is quick and reliable. The microphone capability is noticeably better and walking around while on calls is really appreciated. I did notice that crumpling paper or running water (for dishes) are picked up very easily by my audience. They are comfortable and pretty good for listening to music while being available for calls. I have a pair of Beyer Dynamic headphones that are better, but I did not decrease the noise cancelling level on the Bose, so perhaps the difference will not be as great when adjusted. I did get a call on my phone while on a Zoom meeting that allowed folks to hear my phone call, which I've learned to avoid. The Bluetooth seems to allow for two devices only, not more. The controls on the ear cups are good, but not always picked up the first time; make contact with a finger relatively firmly and move deliberately and it works. The battery life is not as long as the AAA battery in the 25's and is fixed in place, rechargeable with a USB-C cable. The fixed battery and frequent cycling makes me think that they will not last as long as my 25's. I got them during Prime Day, so the price was more than acceptable for the freedom of movement and improved microphone. I'm pretty happy with these and would recommend them at the price point (and especially so when lower!) if they last a few years.",08/20/2022,AFXYDZWFWXTXYHLEREPP5VUR5MBQ,1,4,Color: Black
494,R3B28U1E35EC91,B07Q9MJKBV,4.0 out of 5 stars It's good for music.,Tenebrae,4,"My girlfriend has a medical issue where certain sounds echo inside her head and cause extreme irritability, so I figured I'd look for an exceptionally good headset in the hopes that she would stop giving me those death eyes whenever I'm frantically rapping upon the keyboard in my endless Twitter debates. For me, it worked pretty well at canceling out certain sounds...but fails miserably at neutralizing birds. Why my girlfriend decided to get birds with her hearing issues is beyond me, but such is life... Either way, the headphones didn't help her at all without music playing, and seeing as how she wants absolute silence...this just didn't work out for us. Will it work out for you? Well, with the way it worked for me...I assume anyone looking to listen to SOMETHING while wearing these will get exactly what they want, if you don't have birds, but if you're looking for headphones that completely silence the world around you with or WITHOUT music playing...these just aren't it.With music, a movie, or whatever playing? Yeah...these will likely work out great for you. I enjoyed trying them out and they were definitely better than my Razer ear-buds with noise canceling, which were heaps better than Sony's earbuds.SO, enjoy...and avoid birds if you have any issues with loud sounds.",08/7/2022,AHH2T3H5LHXEZGNV3LVXLTFNT5CQ,1,1,Color: Black
495,R2BPSXEKN94DD7,B07Q9MJKBV,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great audio quality, phone app is glitchy, had problems working with some PC app",Dave,3,"I listened to a music selection with two other headphones I have, and comparatively, I found the Bose 700 a step above the Avantree ANC031 in terms of audio quality and a few steps above in noise cancellation, but not really ""better"", so much as different in audio quality when compared with the Anker SoundCore Strike 3 headphones, which do not have noise cancellation. The Avantree sound is nice but comparatively muffled compared to the clearer, brighter, more articulated sound in the Bose 700. However, I like the bass, mid and treble quality of the Anker headset more than the Bose, being that the Strike 3's bass, mid and treble ranges sound is not only more balanced, but also fuller, and for lack of a better word, more robust. This may be because the Strike 3 is built for gaming and producing 7.1 surround sound, predisposing any music to sounding more immersive and all encompassing, but I personally like hearing music in that way. I realize the Strike 3's is wired, not wireless (the Bose 700 is both), the Strike 3's mic is extended and detacheable, with really good noise-cancelling, voice-isolating capability, vs. the Bose 700 having a built-in noise-cancelling mic. The two products are made for different users - someone who needs to be mobile or stationary and someone who's just stationary. But if I had to just sit down, I can detach the mic from the Anker and enjoy its audio just as much as the 700.The reason I gave the Bose less than 5 stars, though is because of the problems I had with the Bose Music app. Too many times, my smartphone would say I'm connected to the headphones and I'd hear Spotify playing, but the Bose Music app would say I'm not connected. Or it just wouldn't consistently connect to the headphones. I also had problems getting the 700's mic to work with Microsoft Teams and Google Voice on my Windows 10 PC. I was looking for top-notch headphones that I could connect to my PC communications applications, as well as reliably work my smartphone and the 700 didn't do that for me. But if you're just looking to use the 700 with your smartphone and you're willing to play with occasional glitches in syncing the app to the actual state of the headphones, the audio quality is great. The 700's noise cancellation levels are noticeably different and its very useful to adjust the cancellation level to let in the surrounding noise if you have to pay attention to occasional sounds around you, like waiting to hear an announcement over an intercom or listening for your child's voice.",07/21/2020,AH3WLUECA5T3OAHVBLZLJT2O37MA,1,1,Color: Black

497,R2PEFS7JWI8R7X,B07Q9MJKBV,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply the best headphones you will ever buy,Jeff Capron,5,"First of all, the top review for this product is all wrong. You do NOT need the app for these headphones to function. I had never even used the app for the first month of using these. Either this was once a requirement and is not now, or that reviewer is not telling the truth. You CAN use the app to tweak a bunch of settings, but honestly, it works just fine right out of the box.These are hands down, the best headphones I have ever had and I have tried nearly a dozen over the last 8 years. The sound is absolutely life-like. The mic is studio quality. I use these each and every day for work and play.The battery times are just awesome. The description says 20 hours, but for me, the most I have ever gotten is 18 hours but I am using the mic a lot, so I wouldn't be surprised if I got 20 hours if the mic was not in use.I had many headphones with supposed noise cancellation. I came to the conclusion that this was just a scam feature UNTIL I got this set. It is almost scary how well it works. I have a home office and the family makes noise that interrupts my work but with these on, I hear none of that. In fact, they often startle me when they come in the office to tell me something and have to touch my shoulder so I know they are there. I never thought I would enjoy a ""scam"" feature so much.I think it is a shame that the most ""helpful"" review of this headset is blatantly wrong.

498,R3SG6G65ZZ0SN8,B07Q9MJKBV,1.0 out of 5 stars Destroyed by corporate greed and stupidity,Jonathan H. Schatz,1,"Hi, as an update to the original review (below), I want to just emphasize how angry I am with myself for not returning these in time for refund.Before buying, I want you to think about the following: Bose wants you to pay more than $300 for a pair of headphones with features that you CANNOT DEACTIVATE. 1) The voice assistant button, constantly being activated at unwanted times, you may not choose ""none of the above"" or ""off"" for this feature. Not allowed. 2) The absolutely hopeless gesture controls. THERE IS NO OPTION TO DEACTIVATE THEM. You will be constantly playing, skipping, restarting movies, songs, videos, by scratching your head, taking the item on or off. The cat now has the power to advance your audiobook a few chapters while you're not even in the room.Just image the sheer arrogance that went into this specific decision in the design of this product. We will introduce new features, and we just can't get over how awesome we think they are. In fact, we're so proud of ourselves we will shove them down your throat. It's a $320 pair of headphones, and you the user do not have the ability to control them in a full and customized manner! It's COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, and I will NEVER purchase another Bose product.These headphones have excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. That better be automatic for the price.Why one star? Operation of this item is a disaster. As others have mentioned, you are required to install and use for all substantial settings changes (such as switching between devices) a smart-phone app. Although the app itself is reasonably functional so far, you are required to register and give away ALL control over data about you that will be collected and sold to highest bidders. If you were a business, would you be satisfied with getting people to pay $320 for a pair of headphones? Well, it's not enough for the insatiable vampire of greed that is the Bose Corp. You will be milked at every turn through exploitation of personal data over which you may have no control whatsoever. (Read the terms. It's an impressive piece of more or less shameless corporate skullduggery.)That's not the real deal-breaker, though. The gesture controls are a nightmare. Want to adjust volume? You must wave your finger in a magical way and hope for the best. Occasionally the volume goes in the desired direction, although precise control (i.e. small jumps) is not even possible. The rest of the time, something else will happen -- pause, skip to end or beginning of song, video, or even entire movie. Hitting the gestures along with some of the buttons unintentionally at other times is nearly impossible. Nothing like setting your headphones aside for a while to come back and find your audiobook has been playing the whole time, and good look getting back to where you actually left off.The gesture controls CANNOT BE TURNED OFF. IT'S NOT AN OPTION. Google the discussions on this around various forums (including Bose's own). If you want to wear the headphones under a hood, there will be a constant stream of unwanted gesture control inputs with head movements. Read the nightmare stories from people in cold rainy climates with the misfortune to have purchased this item.Don't use a voice assist program like Siri or Alexa? Well for this item turns out ""none of the above"" again is NOT AN OPTION when you set up the device and are asked to choose your assistant. As a result, because of the particularly poor location of the voice assist button, you'll regularly be talking to one whether you like it or not. (I now know Siri's responses to a wide variety of profanity-laced invective.)In sum, some sort of corporate group-think decision process led to a conclusion that forcing neato (but really not ready for prime time) features on users was the way to go. Completely inexcusable for an item at this price point.",03/20/2021,AHA7R2SM4CRBVLBWBUVO72DCJ6FQ,1,22,Color: Black

500,RR2BBF10DJ1YI,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best noise cancelling headphones money can buy.,Bryan,5,"These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.",04/13/2024,AEU5UJKGXQ6DSRMACQYMYZ5IG26A,1,181,Color: Black
501,R3ODEWU6VR0GD7,B0CCZ1L489,"5.0 out of 5 stars Bose's best offering to date if you value sound quality, comfort, and ANC",Oliver,5,"I own the Bose QC45 and have recently tried comparable headphones in this class including the B&W PX7 S2 and Sennheiser Momentum 4. The Bose QC Ultra are probably the best among this group when it comes to my top three priorities - sound quality, comfort, and ANC. Here are my relative rankings in these categories:SOUND QUALITYI was a bit skeptical at first that Bose's new Immersion Mode would amount to a mere marketing gimmick, but it's really unlike anything that I've ever heard. It's hard to describe (you have to listen for yourself!). Immersion Mode somehow gives the sense that the audio source is in front of you (almost like speakers), which ultimately creates a more expansive, 3D-ish effect that makes the music ""come alive."" I now listen exclusively in Immersion Mode and don't know that I can go back to the more traditional, ""closed-off"" sound of other headphones. The QC Ultra is a definite step-up from the QC45.I was also impressed with the B&W PX7 S2's balanced and clean sound signature; however, I had to return my pair because the left ear cup suddenly and inexplicably went dead after only a week of gentle use. I contemplated repurchasing because of how good they sound but don't want to take the chance on receiving another dud.While the M4 has a loyal following, I was personally disappointed by the Sennheiser sound signature. The M4 was too bass-heavy for my taste; moreover, the clarity/separation for vocals and instruments was muddy and often overpowered by the bass.Rankings: QC Ultra >= PX7 S2 > QC45 > M4COMFORTBoth the QC45 and QC Ultra live up to the ""comfort"" in their names. Their light weight and plush padding are second to none, with perhaps a slight edge to the QC45. The PX7 S2 is also quite pleasant to wear but a little heavier compared to Bose. I was not a fan of the M4, which felt a bit cheap to me; the material used for the ear pads was not breathable (think hot ears), and the clamping force was tighter than Bose and B&W.Rankings: QC45 >= QC Ultra > PX7 S2 > M4ANCBose has earned a reputation as the ""King of ANC"", a title that is well-deserved IMO. Both the QC45 and QC Ultra are noticeably more effective at drowning out ambient noise than the PX7 S2 and M4.Rankings: QC Ultra = QC45 > PX7 S2 = M4Hope that my observations help you if you're trying to decide between these headphone options. I plan to keep the QC Ultra as Bose has made substantial improvements to the QC45, namely the Immersion Mode, that justify the price differential for me. I do wish that the battery life were longer, but its other distinguishing features make up for it. Overall, I'd give the QC Ultra 4.5 (rounding up to 5) stars!",05/4/2024,AH7Z7HSRSEDGQAGZRQG6E2CRVRRQ,1,47,Color: White Smoke

504,R24X8QCZ5R5EJA,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones in the market!,Amir Hasani,5,"Initial Impressions:From the moment I unboxed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, I was struck by their sleek, sophisticated design. The headphones are incredibly light, and the plush ear cushions felt luxurious the moment I put them on. Powering them up for the first time, I was greeted by a user-friendly voice prompt that guided me through the Bluetooth connection process, which was quick and seamless.Build Quality & Design:The build quality of these headphones is exactly what you would expect from Bose—robust yet refined. They sport a minimalistic style, with a focus on comfort and durability. The materials used are top-notch, ensuring that the headphones not only last but also retain their aesthetic appeal over time. The ear cups rotate and fold neatly, making them perfect for travel and storage.Sound Quality:Bose has always been a pioneer in sound technology, and these headphones are no exception. The sound clarity is exceptional, with rich bass, crisp highs, and detailed mids. Whether I'm listening to classical music, hard rock, or cinematic scores, every genre is rendered with precision and depth. The active noise cancelling function is superb, effectively blocking out external noises and creating an immersive listening environment.Wireless Connectivity:The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, with a strong and stable connection. I can wander around my house with the headphones on without any drop in audio quality or interruptions. Additionally, the multi-connect feature allows the headphones to be connected to two devices simultaneously, which is a great convenience.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive. On a single charge, I can get up to 20 hours of playtime with noise cancelling on, which is more than enough for a day's use or a long flight. The quick charge feature is also a lifesaver, providing hours of playtime with just a few minutes of charging.Additional Features:One standout feature is the adjustable noise cancelling, which allows you to modify the level of noise cancellation depending on your environment. The touch-sensitive controls on the ear cups are intuitive, providing easy access to volume, track control, and voice assistants.Final Thoughts:The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are a testament to what high-quality headphones can offer. They provide a perfect blend of style, comfort, and superior sound quality, with noise cancelling that truly stands out in busy environments. Whether for travel, work, or just enjoying your favorite tunes at home, these headphones are an excellent investment. They earn a well-deserved five stars for elevating my audio experience beyond expectations.",05/5/2024,AFWHMQCSZG6TLEWC6FVIHKWOQY4A,1,12,Color: Black
505,R2YCVGCT28KXGR,B0CCZ1L489,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is flat, but battery life is great.",iWillBreakFree,3,"I have used these headphones almost daily since June 2023 and do not like them. I wish I could return them for something else. I purchased these because I liked their Bose Sport Earbuds, but those were starting to cause earwax to clog up my ear canals. So I decided to buy these to focus on school and work. I wanted to drown out background noise, so I didn't get distracted, which happens easily to me. ""Oh, look, a potato chip!"" - plays with the potato chip. I still use the earbuds when I work out and they function very well for that purpose. Anyways, lets get on with it, here are a few pro's and many con'sPro:1. Battery life is accurate. I normally get about 24 hours of battery life out of them. I'm not timing it, I judge it based on the number of days used which is about 4 days before needing a charge.2. Noise canceling is fantastic. I will sometimes be working in the living room; someone else can be blasting the TV, and it sounds like quiet muddled background noise.Con:1. The expectation of sound quality is terrible, considering the price I paid for them. The sound quality is very flat and muddy, and there is little to no sound separation. I can get similar quality headphones for a quarter of the amount spent on these headphones.2. Comfort is very dependent on your head shape. But with mine, they start to hurt on top of my head where the band is and behind the lower part of my ear. I've adjusted them so they don't squeeze so hard, but they become too loose and easily fall off.3. Auto-Pause is annoying. You have an auto-pause option when you pull them off your right ear. That being said, when I turn my head, they will pause for no reason. It's annoying because there is times it doesn't recognize that it's back on your ears and not play. This means you need to use your phone or press the assigned button each time to start playing. You will need to loosen them a little to stop this, but they can easily fall off. This leaves you to decide if you want them to fall off easily or for it to auto-pause frequently almost every time you turn your head. So, if you plan on using these to work out with, it can be distracting and ruin your flow.4. Bose App. First, the app could be more worthwhile. It allows you to assign the shortcut button on your headphones to very basic features like Hearing Battery Level, Change Immersive Audio, Voice Assistant, and Spotify. A long hold on this button will change your noise-cancelling option. But the app is almost never updated unless it's for some advertisement and never adds any features to your headphones.5. Bose App - EQ. It doesn't You can use this to ""adjust"" the eq, but it only gives you bass/mid/treble and really doesn't do anything to help with the sound quality. If you listen to multiple genres of music like I do, you want the option to have some preset eq settings, but without a proper adjustment of the EQ, it really doesn't matter.6. Bose App/Immersive Audio. This is just marketing crap. If you have it on, when you turn your head to any side, the sound will shift over to the opposite side. That's all. It ruins the sound more when it's on, so I always have it off.7. Wearing the headphones. Not really that bad of a feature. You need to place them on correctly. They have R/L inside each cup and will only work on those sides. So, if you are like me and place them flat on your desk, there is a learning curve to make sure you place them correctly on your head.Conclusion:Save your money. I would recommend other headphones, but I am not made of money and don't have a ton of different headphones to suggest. Please take another look at other options in this price range. Bose, if you read this, can we talk about returning them so I can get my money back, I still have the original case that these came with.",07/2/2024,AFO2DKPA3M27JFTIWXGRSBDVGFZQ,1,0,Color: Black
506,RMARAQXAFN8Z9,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!,SawyerMan,5,"To start out, I must say I am very fussy about audio. I have a small recording studio, which I spend at least eight hours a day in. I have three different sets of headphones, which all have a personality of their own when it comes to sound and mixing, I have a couple of Bose speakers which are excellent and have always been impressed with their products. I did not buy these with the intent of mixing, just for listening out of the studio. Most headphones don’t reflect what a good pair of studio monitors produce. These headphones , do an excellent job of reproducing accurate recordings, good and bad. The features of these headphones was really more than I needed, but I was presently surprised how good they sounded. As I have found over the years with Bose, there was always a little problem in the mids, but the clarity was so clear it was a no-brainer. Ever since I’ve started using these I can’t get them off my ears. I started using them in place of my flat response headphones because they give me a good reflection of my monitors. they are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the features are top-notch in the noise cancellation is about as good as it gets in a set of headphones. The volume control can be a little bit hard to get used to, but the more I use them the easier it gets, as usual. The one thing I don’t really care for and it’s being kind of picky is, I normally will use these with a wired connection in the studio to avoid any latency by using Bluetooth. But you have to have the headphones powered on even when wire direct. My other headphones don’t use any battery power when plugged in direct. Now, if you’re into high-tech, you’re going to love the immersive settings on these cans. I have no idea how they pull this off and it wasn’t the reason that I bought them in the first place, but these things are awesome. I guess there’s no way I can really explain how they work and what it sounds like so I guess you’ll have to buy a pair for yourself. The problem with that is that they are a little pricey as always with Bose, but I think in this case they’re worth it. I was prepared to send these back if they didn’t sound good, simply based on how much they cost , so I was pleasantly surprised and how good they were. If you can get by the price, you will be happy with these headphones. Nothing is perfect, that’s for sure, but in the audio department these things come pretty close….Nice job Bose !",05/2/2024,AH2EV4FBMGFY4OCQTR2KGXU4YC4Q,1,22,Color: Black
507,RGSDD50WQC9SO,B0CCZ1L489,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancelling, call quality, and sound. Terrible everything else.",User312938,3,"I have owned numerous QC35's, QC45's, and a pair of 700s. I've tried some Sony's but never used them as my daily driver. I wear my headphones nearly all day while I work, go to the gym, take walks, and frequently when falling asleep. These are a a substantial upgrade over previous Bose headphones in the sound department, but a MAJOR downgrade in literally every other way.Pros-Fantastic noise cancelling-Great call quality-Good sound quality-Fold flatCons-Much flimsier (at the hinge) than QC45-Volume adjuster is basically useless for anything other than large changes. Trying to get just the right volume while listening to a podcast? Have damp fingers at the gym? Have long hair? In a quiet room and need fine adjustments? Don't even bother using the headphone volume slider.-Ear cups are slightly smaller and less soft than QC45-Ear cups wear out much faster than QC45-Power button functioning is inconsistent. Sometimes it does nothing, sometimes has a long pause. No correlation to on head detection. It's just such a step back from the QC45-Sometimes reboots randomly-Immersive audio is gimmic, or at the very least isn't compatible with a very active lifestyle and using these headphones in many daily environments-On head detection/auto off works inconsistently when wearing them while head against a pillow-These things just waste your time. Want to turn them off - hold the button and count to 3. So you probably had to think about it for a total of 4 seconds. If you turn them off 5 times in a day, that's 20 seconds a day. If I do that say 6 days a week, I'm spending 2 minutes per week just thinking about turning my headphones off. That's 104 minutes per year I'm literally thinking about turning these stupid things off. Want to check the battery level? You have to wait for them to do the boot cycle, then speak to you, then turn them off by holding the off button for 3 seconds.-Nitpick vs QC45 #1: no quick way to just feel the headphone and know which side is R/L to put them on your head. There's a tiny button you can try to find, but it's not like the On/Off switch you could feel on the QC45-Nitpick vs QC45 #2: The button to turn them off is on the side of the headphone WITHOUT the USB C power jack, so have to move them in your hands, then plug them in.-not water proofI feel like Bose decided they had to follow Sony and Apple in trying to keep up with ""modern features"" and style, but in doing so they really have lost a lot of the great functionality that made the previous models so amazing.The next good over-ear headphones I invest in will probably not be Bose.",05/8/2024,AHU45EABLFNNPWPHAHU42RJ67U6Q,1,49,Color: Black
508,RW608C3GWLZZA,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound quality but some minor build quality issues,Rocky Soamc,4,"I'm fairly picky about my noise canceling headphones. I've owned Sony XM-5, Sony XM-4, Bose Quiet Comfort 700 and these outperform all of those by at least a small but noticable amount. The ANC isn't magic, but it is as effective as anything I've used. On a recent flight I had a screaming infant about 3 rows back and while it couldn't block all of the sound, it barely intruded and wasn't noticable when a song was actively playing. Sound quality is excellent and the immersive audio feature is a welcome addition. My only gripe as far as audio quality is that Bose seems to subscribe to Apple's philosophy about the user experience: they're going to put some effort into creating a nice experience, but you'd better agree at least on the broad strokes of what makes for a nice user experience because they don't give you much wiggle room to customize it. I'd like to be able to tune the sound to my liking a little bit more. Bose keeps the EQ simple--a little too simple for my tastes--with the option only to adjust low mid and high. Compared to what Sony's app offers this feels very restrictive. A few more bands on the EQ would be a welcome addition.My only complaints are minor: After two months of daily use, the stitching on the ear pads has come apart with about 60% of the stitching on each side separated already. At this price point, I'd expect better durability and longevity. Replacement pads range from about $22 to $35, so this isn't a meaningless complaint.The other minor annoyance is I wish these had a little bit more ""clamping power"" in the headband. I understand that you have to strike a balance between squeezing somebody's head like it's in a vice and the headphones staying in place no matter what you're doing with your head, but these err a little too much on the loose side. Clearly these aren't intended to use as your workout headphones, but even just lying down on a flat bench is generally going to make them come off your ears.Everything else seems to function properly and be holding up well and I do not regret the purchase. They're very expensive, but not necessarily a bad value. I had to work pretty hard to justify a $400 set of headphones, but if it's something that you'll use enough and effective noise cancelling is a must have, these might barely edge into the "" justifiable luxury"" column, but will never be anywhere near ""practical"".",05/23/2024,AFH7EWSZGJ5SANZTGPSUR4CWONZQ,1,14,Color: Black

Band made out of aluminum even with hinge so that's solid.Cons:These headphones can tend to become a fingerprint magnet especially on the bose logo, a solution would be to buy a cover or get a vinal sticker to cover them to your liking.And you can't seem to turn off the anc, only way I seemed to was to make a custom profile and turn the anc all the way down. About the app, the immersion mode is a little lack luster to what I was expecting, makes the headphones sound like a speaker system around you in a hollow room? (Would like a way to change that echoing and such)All in all?These are a premium headset and a lot of these issues can be fixed through the apps settings like the wake on lift ect, turning that off will make the pair turn on faster through the power button, I do miss the switch for power, but to give an automatic power on and off so I can be less worried about forgetting to turn them off is such a nice feature vs you forget to turn off the qc 35 off and now they are 25% in the morning, more or less these are for people who want the best of the best from bose, any issues I've seen from the 1 stars seem to be a user error as these cans will sound as good as they can with a capable phone, don't bother pairing these with a old phone that doesn't supoort adpt x or ACC and expect the best sounding experience.",05/3/2024,AGF4LKTHI73ZXZ32JMENWS75CLQA,1,20,Color: Sandstone

I mean seriously ! & they’re soooo comfortable. So plush. Not heavy. Just a perfect fit and perfect ear cups !The immersion mode is INSANE !!!I’m literally so happy I did my research and got these. It was between these and the APMax but I decided to go with these. I don’t regret it at all. These get really loud as well.I still would like the Max because I’m in love with that sky blue color but these are def better in my opinion (aside from aesthetic).& they’re on sale !

516,R320NMU6Z0NILV,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound! I like the bass and noise cancellation is very good,Gordiro,5,"I purchased these headphones to use them in the gym while working out. The place always has loud music playing which is not of my taste. So I just put these on and I can hear my music while using a treadmill, elliptical, or lifting weights.They are very comfortable, and I consider myself an audiophile. The sound quality is fair enough and I can enjoy listening not only instrumental music but also classic rock.I didn't like the volume control. It's not so easy or the tactile feedback is not there. Many times I ended up pressing a button looking for the volume bar.Also, when I use them with my Android phone, just by touching the volume bar the phone would switch from Tidal to Spotify for no reason.I decided not to use the volume bar at all.

517,R30RY1LCLTMU71,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Not ready for prime time!,Matt,4,"EDIT (1/8/2024): I discovered a workaround that is partially effective. In the Bose Music app, on the Modes tab, hit the + button to add a new mode. On this tab, you can access a Noise Cancellation level slider with 10 levels. Putting the slider about half way allows enough ambient sound to come through that you can hear yourself speak while still reducing distractions around you. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Number one thing you need to know: If you're using these for meetings or phone calls, wait. Right now, there is a bug where you cannot hear yourself speak (i.e. self voice / side tone doesn't work). It's as if you're conducting a meeting with ear plugs in. This is Bose firmware 1.5.4 (for those of you reading this in the future).I've tried this on two different headsets, one from Amazon, one from Walmart, different manufacturing dates. It flat out doesn't work - there is no difference between high self voice and off. I've also updated the Bose Music app - doesn't help. The good news is that this is probably a software bug as aware mode seems to work (can hear myself speak but also hear everything else in the room as well).Bottom line - I think this headset is nice, but I'm not sure about it being worth $420, and definitely not worth that amount when I have to switch to my older QC35s to conduct Teams meetings so I can hear myself speak.Also not a fan of the solid state volume slider. I much prefer the buttons on the QC35 series.Edit: On the Pro side: one not advertised feature is bluetooth range. This headset supports bluetooth 5.3 which is a significant upgrade from 4.x that the QC 35ii supports. With this headset, I can leave my phone in one corner of the house and walk all the way over to the other corner with no loss of signal. It's more than double the range of the older bluetooth protocols. The headset is backwards compatible with bluetooth 4 devices, but to get this benefit, make sure your phone / laptop / whatever supports bluetooth 5.On the negative side, another feature that annoys me on this set of headphones is the on-head detection. The way it's supposed to work is that when you take off your headphones, they automatically pause whatever is playing and go into a low power state. In theory...In practice, this is somewhat annoying for two reasons:1. It's not bullet proof. Maybe 1 out of 20 times I take off the headphones, it doesn't detect it and the music keeps playing. The benign case is when music is playing and you notice it and fix it. The treacherous case is when you've already paused the music, take off the headset, and then it doesn't go low power mode. Next time you wear them the battery will be dead. 2. If you take off the headphones, they don't disconnect from Bluetooth right away. It takes some time before it disconnects. So you end up having to manually disconnect anyway to use your phone / laptop speakers instead of the headset, and at that point you wonder why these don't simply have a slider on / off switch like the older models.",11/13/2023,AHCZVQCWBAMXLKKZQXHPNKGS4YNA,1,36,Color: Black
518,R1RYUC7VIVASHD,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Connection... Issues,Hipnyah,4,"Well i love evening about them as long as they are connected. I use these for online desktop gaming, fully charged and purposely connected. I a 45 minute match it will randomly diviner twice on average. Now that is annoying enough, but it gets a little worse. The microphone is atrocious. I went and spent another 100 bucks on getting a really good ml standing microphone for my pc. Now into why I traded these so highly. The sound quality is good enough that your songs sound different. They sound so much better. Not to say audiophile grade, but certainly a cut above my astro a40s from before. (tho it's 3 generations old by now) and instead of the ASTRO a50s (Bluetooth variant as opposed to the corded I use to run) I chose these. They're great. Multiple profiles to control the sound canceling (which is blissful quiet on my bus rides) and great app support that can add custom profiles that adjust anc and tge gain, boos, eq and so many more small fidly bits. Also great. There is one more gripe, however it's more personal. The long press isn't touch receptive, it's distance. And if you raise a hand over you head or chill on your did on a couch and your shoulder gets near em you activate your long press on the volume motion slide. It's jarring.",04/17/2024,AGBGZKZG6XXQY72HV2C2IREKX5YA,1,5,Color: Black

I'm always impressed with the sound and quality of the headphones. This iteration also has touch volume controls. Personally, I find the touch controls difficult to use (Use? No! Find while fumbling with my finger on the side of my head, yes! Difficult to find.) IMO, the noise cancellation works better on the QC Ultra Earbuds but that more because they're designed to seal up the ear canal.

The Sony XM5's at the time were the best noise canceling over the year Headphones. When Bose came out with the quiet comfort Ultra I decided to give him a shot after my second set of XM5's broke In the same spot. Every review out there said that the Bose quiet comfort ultras We're the best. I purchased the Bose and had them for several days and throughout that time, I had missed my XM5's. Don't get me wrong, the Bose are excellent headphones. They sound great, but their volume is very low. The Sony's have higher volume. They're bass is not as good as the Sony's. The microphone on the Bose for making phone calls is horrible. The Sony XM5 microphone Is incredible. I was standing right next to a power washer, speaking to my wife with the Sony's, and she could not hear the power washer and heard me perfectly. I definitely recommend the Sony's. They are a little bit less expensive and I think they of are of equal or not better sound. Let me restate that. They definitely have better sound than the Bose. The noise canceling is as good or better. No matter what set of headphones that you purchase, I would definitely purchase the extended warranty. I think buying the warranty is priceless. They covered both breakages on my Sony's. When you get to this level of headphones. It really, probably, comes down to the end user. I happen to think the Sony's are a far better sounding.

I sucked it up to make the purchase and I have to say... I LOVE these things. The noise cancellation is fantastic. I love the ability to fully control them from either the app or the headset itself. Calls are super clear.There IS a white noise that plays in the background when you go full immersion, but I don't see how else this level of noise cancellation could be accomplished without some kind of feedback sound.To be fair, my ears do get hot when I've had them on for a fair amount of time. I'm not sure if anything can be done about that since they are over-the-ear, but it would be nice if they could find a good solution.Overall sound quality is as you would expect BOSE to produce. These are amazing and easily worth the money I paid. Are they for everyone? No - Just audiophiles who love a full range sound experience.

Microphone sounds good, noise cancellation is improved from the QC45 model I was using. My one minor gripe which I won't fault the product for because it may be my head shape.Since this unit doesn't use a locking mechanism for the ear position, it's difficult for me to find the proper spot to comfortably wear the ear cups. On the QC45's I knew that one click on each side was the perfect fit, so when I traveled with them and took them out of the case it was a single click on each side and I was good to go. When I take these out of the travel case I have to fiddle with them to get the proper position.

My old ones were micro-usb....Cons:-I don't like the button layout. My old quiet comforts were very easy to figure out with the slider. I always knew when they were on/ off, and what mode they were in. These require you to hold down on certain buttons to turn them off, switch modes, etc. It's not very intuitive and almost forces you to use the app to figure out what's going on.-You STILL cannot charge the headset while listening. Had this same problem with my 2019 Quiet Comforts. Surprised to see they haven't figured this out.-Battery life is improved but not nearly enough.-App is buggy and takes awhile to connect.-STILL has the random issue of no audio output if connected to two devices in certain circumstances. In my experience, this happens if connected to a laptop and a phone.Overall it's not a huge upgrade over my previous set and still has the same bugs/limitations.

The noise cancellation is actually quite good, and I appreciate the “Aware” mode, though perhaps having a noise cancellation slider would be better. Another area of improvement is the distance it can maintain connection. I can walk considerable farther away from my phone and the audio in the headphones remains clear. The headphones are pretty comfortable, thought sometimes listening for long periods of time while wearing glasses can cause some soreness. The battery life is pretty good, though I suggest fully powering off the headphones when done rather than relying on the low power mode. Where this product starts to lose points with me is the auto-pause/sleep feature for when you remove the headphones. A lot of times, this feature will trigger when I’m in the middle of listening to something. Perhaps it’s due to a particular head movement, or something else, but I find myself having to manually resume playback despite not having taking the headphones off. I wish this feature had a toggle as I’d much rather forgo the sleep feature and just power the device on/off manually than worry about whether my audio is going to stop because I looked right.

538,R3V27GZ2MQ76FU,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to QC35,jharmon,5,"This review is going to be based on how much of an upgrade these are compared to the QC35.Sound: Short answer is they are noticeably better even without the immersive sound option. The bass can “hit” much harder and has a richer deeper sound. I thought that the QC35 did a fantastic job of putting me in the environment of the music I was listening to, but the Ultra’s do an even better job. I like to have a headspace of escape when I use my headphones while I work and these do an even better job. I’ll be honest about the immersive audio feature that I am not sure it’s something I value. I have tried to listen to songs repeatedly with it on and off, it I do not feel it adds much to the experience. Perhaps my viewpoint will change with time.User Interface: The multi-function button has more options than the QC35 button. I like the volume slider vs buttons because it allows you to make smaller volume adjustments vs pre-determine volume adjustments. You keep your finger on the touch slider and move it slowly. I wish Bose had used the touch panel option for the track management like they did on the 700. Clicking the multi-function button 2x to go forward; 3x to go backward. 4x is set in the app whatever you want it to do. The headphones will go into stand-by if you lay the cups flat on a table or surface. The LED will pulse slowly to know you are in stand-by. I have left my QC35 on many times to come back disappointed to find them dead. Then when you pick them up and put them on your ears they come out of sleep mode. USB-C is nice, the QC35 was micro-usb and I don’t tend to use that style of cable anymore.Build: The hinges on this seem to be more sturdy than the qc35. The hinge action is smooth with no clicking. The headband is a bit sturdier as well. The cushions are a bit more stiff than the QC35 so hopefully that leads to more longevity because the older style tends to wear out and you have to replace them.APP: One thing that hampers the QC35 more than the new version of the headphone which I think is the QC35II and later is the options available in the Bose Music App verses the Bose Connect App. The Bose Music has much better fined tuned features with regards to the noise cancellation options and equalizer settings. The QC45 and 700 I know use the Bose MusicMic: I have used this for many phone calls and virtual meetings. I haven’t received any complaints about being heard or being clear.",10/31/2023,AGOVEPTEREULH6ONEIG6745WD2WQ,1,21,Color: Black

546,R195JPWMXEMTMP,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation but not always an upgrade from QC 45,Jeremiah Brandt,3,"I bought the QC Ultra with high hopes to replace my older QC 45 that was starting to have problems. I've used Bose headphones including QC 35 II and QC 45 since 2021. I use Bose headphones because they have good sound quality and are very comfortable. The sound quality and noise cancellation of QS Ultra was noticeably better than the older Bose headphones I used. The comfort of the QS 45 matches older Bose headphones. After using the QC Ultra for a couple of days, I returned them and bought a new pair of QS 45 to replace my older QC 45. Overall the QC Ultra are better is several aspects, but because of the cons listed below I prefer the QC 45.Pros:- Great sound quality: The sound quality of the QC Ultra is excellent. I noticed the sound quality is slightly better than my QC 45.- Great noise cancellation: The noisecancellation of the QC Ultra is better than my previous QC 45. I noticed little difference between my last QC 45 and these.- Very comfortable: The QC Ultra, like my previous QC 45, are very comfortable and I can wear them all day.Cons:- No physical button for volume control: The volume control is a slider. I found it difficult to set the volume to the lowest setting using the slider. Buttons make this much easer because I just needed to click until volume was turned off then up one click.- No dedicated physical button for power: The headphones are supposed to turn off automatically when you put them away. There is a button you can long press to turn off the headphones. I found the long press too time-consuming and found the physical power switch on my QC 45 to be more intuitive, faster, and convenient.- Automatic pauses are unpredictable: The QC Ultra is supposed to pause media automatically whenever they are taken off. I found that sometimes when I'm turning my head or opening my jaw wide the headphones would pause media. This was very annoying. I also lie down wearing headphones on one ear. The QC Ultra automatically turn of media when only wearing one ear. It's possible to unpause media through your phone. However, if you shift your head, the QC Ultra will typically pause media again. This was also annoying and not a problem with the QS 45.",03/5/2024,AHJWSXX57Q42X4YFS4HLSB3Y7GDA,1,16,Color: Black
547,R2YP4ID328PUTK,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sounding Bose Headphones I Have Ever Heard!,Aluzion TV,5,"These are simply the best Bose headphones I have ever heard. Usually Bose has made headphones that are lacking in Bass and while that works for a lot of people, it never worked for me. Im happy to report that these headphones have really nice punchy bass and an EQ in the Bose Music App that you can tune these headphones to your exact liking.The app is good and all works well.- The Multi-Point connection takes a little time to understand how it works. You can have up to 2 devices connected at the same time, but you have to stop the audio on the first device before you can start the second device. Once you learn that it works great. *Within the ""Sources"" section of the Bose Music App you can mage all connected devices and I believe you can store up to 8 devices here. Each device will have an On/Off slider that you can choose to have active at the same time as your phone or main device.I like this because I have both of my TV's, My iMac, iPad and phone saved here and can choose which devices I want to listen to by turning on or off that specific slider.- The sound quality of these headphones is honestly what I have been looking for, for sometime.I listen to Dance and EDM a lot and these headphones sound amazing. Plenty of Bass that is clear and punchy. You can fine tune everything within the EQ section of the Bose Music App. This is something that I honestly love about using these headphones. ALL HEADPHONES should have an adjustable EQ that stays with the headphones not just in an app.- The battery life has also been very good no complaints here.- The weight of these headphones is simply awesome for carrying around in my backpack and wearing them. It's almost like you're not wearing anything at all! Very comfortable and lightweight. I use them on the train everyday and I am very happy.- The case is also amazing. The headphones fold down and pack very nicely into this really nicely constructed case. It's also one of my favorite things about these headphones. Having a nice custom case from the manufacturer is where it's at. Aftermarket cases for most things tend to not have perfect fitment or build quality and can be bulky.There’s more but honestly I think I covered the most import things and I def recommend them.",01/20/2024,AGUIDLDIOAE4GTNEFYZ4HSFY52RA,1,66,Color: Black

549,R1RLRMEQP1UOQ,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Quality and Comfort - Wow!!!,"Anime, Manga and Harlequin Romance Girl",5,"I don't know where to start, the comfort?! the sound quality?! Ok I'll talk about the sound quality and features - Wow, wow, wow!! I REALLY love the Immersion setting. Basically, the Immersion setting means the noise cancelling option is to the highest level so the sound is REALLY crisp and no outside sounds interferes with whatever you are listening to. I was really blown away by the musical theater video I was listening to. The noise cancelling feature is REALLY superb. I was also in my room with an air purifier on - which is loud by the way. The Bose noise cancelling feature REALLY dimmed the sound of my air purifier. I would say it blocked 85 - 90% of the air purifier sound. Next are the controls. I've only been using the volume controls and it is the right side of the headphones. It's really cool that it's touch sensitive. There are no buttons - you just slide your finger up and down. The volume control is VERY responsive which is really cool. When I take the headphones off it automatically pauses the video or song (neat!) I like the fact that I won't be ""wearing out"" any buttons. As for comfort I love the fact that it DEFINITELY fits over my ears. I have no fear of pinched ears and lack of blood flow. The headphone pads is very soft, plush and comfortable. I stretched the headphone to its maximum length and it was good for my head. The feel of everything was just slick and smooth . I haven't tested the battery yet. I will update once I do. the case is great and easy to use. It has a hole for the pads which is pretty convenient. I will be using the case because this Bose headphone costs a few dollars. I don't have to mention that this uses USB-C and they provide the cord. I also like the fact that I can connect two different devices. I have android and there were no issues connecting to it but I made sure to download the Bose app. There is an IMMERSION DEMO which sounds VERY cool and you really get to hear the high quality audio features. I had no problems connecting it to my Windows computer. Very happy with my headphones. I plan to bring this to swim competitions where it can get very loud.",11/2/2023,AHTJTOZLQUSM6DJEK6OGETUILBNA,1,42,Color: Black

551,R2IP1MVFB2Y3GL,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing headphones that’s lightweight and mutes noises,Alan,5,"Don’t read all the most recent negative reviews here; most people who are truly enjoying the headphones are not leaving reviews because they are enjoying the amazing sound and quality of the headphones! Besides, most negative and positive reviews can be fake anyway, lol.I was questioning whether I should buy these or not due to many negative reviews, but then I realized most people only review here to complain, and it’s true that every product has a 2-10% chance of being faulty. Anyway, I’m glad I made the purchase. I’ve had AirPods Max, Sony XM5, and Beats Studio, but so far, the Ultra is a beast and amazing.I can hear every instrument, and the bass is quite good; it’s not overwhelming like the XM5. Like the bass is not distracting; it’s definitely a bassy headphone, but unlike the XM5 or Beats Studio, where the bass muffles other sounds. The immersive feature is a bit gimmicky, but it does surprise me. The volume control is odd I don’t like it, wish there was physical button besides the slider.The weight is amazing, and I’d say it’s probably the most comfortable headphone I have in my collection. I’ve worn it for 6 hours straight studying without any issues. Unlike the Apple Max, it’s definitely lightweight and comfortable. However, the build is very light and plasticky, but it doesn’t feel cheap at all, if you're wondering; it just feels extremely light.Portability is okay; the case is not my favorite, but it does the trick. It’s just annoying that you have to reset the strap height every time you try to fit it inside the case. However, the battery in this thing is quite good, not amazing, but very good. I can listen consecutively for 16 hours with 10% battery left, and that’s with noise cancellation on (your experience can vary depending on the volume you’re listening to; I listen to my music at around 75% to 80% volume) all the time, so yeah, it can drain battery.It’s an amazing pair of headphones, so if you have the money for it, why not?",02/12/2024,AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,1,27,Color: Black

553,R26VVYH3J8A929,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best of the Best!,LAMGA1,5,"I purchased the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones from Amazon and am very impressed! Bose has always been at the top of list for the best headphones and these do not disappoint! First off, they are very light and comfortable. The ear cups feel large and the speakers are angled in the headphones to give your ears plenty of space and direct the sound into them. Downloading the Bose Music App allows you to control the settings. One thing I love is the ability to connect two devices via Bluetooth at the same time. For example, you can connect the app on your phone and an iPod or speaker at the same time and control them both.The headphones have three modes: Quiet Mode, Aware Mode, and Immersive Audio Mode. Quiet Mode gives the most noise reduction, and even with a fan or air conditioner running nearby is impressively quiet. Aware Mode allows you to hear what is going on around you and still hear the music. The newest mode and what makes the Ultra headphones unique is the spatial audio feature called Immersive Audio. This mode plays the music as if it is coming from in front of you. You can choose one of two modes: Still Mode for sitting still and Motion Mode for walking or moving around. In Still Mode, the music is always only in front of you so if you turn your head, you hear it out of only one ear cup and vice versa when you turn your head the other way. In Motion Mode, the music is always in front of you so as you turn your head, it moves to stay in front of you. This is by far my new favorite mode.As far as controls, the Ultra headphones only have two buttons and a volume slider on the right ear cup. These control the Bluetooth connection and pause, skip forward, or skip backward. The volume slider is a unique feature that It is located on the right earcup and by sliding your finger along it can raise and lower the volume. I like the idea, but it does not always work well for me. You can also customize the slider so that by tapping it, the headphones will tell you how much battery life is left. Removing the headphones pauses the music and putting them back on resumes it. You can also set the duration for how long until they power off in the Bose Music App.I do think the price point is a little high for the segment; but overall, I really do like these new Ultra headphones and highly recommend them!",10/24/2023,AEWHPVCVF23XWQRIUOMKSVNZG7JA,1,20,Color: Black
554,RHCMKJ7P0ZQ37,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars OMG what a step down in usability features. Kill that robo voice!,Dave deBronkart,3,"For years I loved my QC35 ii. Comfortable, great features, and the extra nifty ability to use them with dead battery using an ordinary audio cable.No more with these things! No sound unless power is on, and some genius removed the volume wheel, replacing it with a surface-touch sliding rib. Harder to use - and when you hit bottom of the scale, it doesn't just go silent, it makes a loud CLUNK sound in your ear! LOVELY when I'm in bed trying to fall asleep.But the worst ""improvement"" is that when you poke the button to modify the ANC, instead of quiet-to-loud beeps, you get an annoyed robo-lady who snarks ""AWARE!"" (for ANC off) or ""IMMERSION"".Ugh. So I'm going back to the QC35 ii (renewed) at less than half the price.",06/26/2024,AGJLBVPA4IMWR566SIMTRWZ66ZLA,1,0,Color: White Smoke
555,RV4F83P5684M0,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Sound great but not good for a small head,Chris,3,"These are extremely comfortable to wear and they sound great once you use the EQ to reduce the bass. The stock EQ curve is really bad in my opinion. After just a few minutes I had them sounding great. The spatial audio isn't great, however. Pros mix albums of music to be listened to in stereo, and it's best to listen to it the way they intended. This spatial audio is interesting but it's a gimmick.The dealbreaker for me is that these do not clamp on my head much at all. They move around when I turn my head or look down. They move around so much that it makes a loud sound when I try to move at a decent speed with them on. I would like to be able to do a light jog with these on but there is no way I could hear the media while jogging due to the headphones bouncing up and down on my head. Earbuds are much much better for me. Maybe my head is smaller than I thought. If you have a small head, don't buy these.They did not disappoint in terms of comfort, ease of use and sound.

This isn't even touching on the comfort of the headphones themselves, which actually allows for long sessions with glasses on my face without pain.

559,R1VCE67YU7ENPU,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose Does it Again,Elaine,5,"Let me start by saying, I am an audiophile and I am constantly trying new headphones and new audio technology. In my opinion, Bose still stands far above the competetion in most catagories. The crisp sound, unmatched comfort, and superior noise cancelling set these QuietComfort Ultra headphones apart from everything I have used. I travel a lot for work and I am constantly grabbing this headset for the airport, loud flights, and just leisure music listening.Design:As you take the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones out of the case you will immediately note that it has the same sleek curves and overall clean appearance of a Bose product. The case fits the headphones perfectly with enough room for small accessories like a charging and auxiliary chord.Comfort:These are easily the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever used. The ear cushions are made of the distinct Bose memory foam and they are fully adjustable to any head size. I wore them on a 8-hour long-haul flight and my head didnt hurt or have suction/red marks from overuse. I was incredibly impressed.Intuitiveness:The controls and simplicity of the button layout is something that I really started to like. The volume is a simple swipe up or down on the side of the headset and the multi-function button is intuitive and does exactly what you would expect. I found that using the app for things like connecting bluetooth and adjusting sound modes worked better than pressing buttons on the headphones themselves.Battery Life:My only small complaint is that using Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) and playing louder music, the battery tends to drain somewhat faster than I expected. After a full charge I find that the headset will drop to 60-70% fairly fast. That being said, the battery has never run out on me, not even once.Noise Cancelling:This headset is far and away the best noise cancelling I have ever experienced with headphones, and I have tried all the major brands. I would say the ANC is slightly better than previous generation Bose headsets. Also, I did not notice fatigure or ANC induced headaches, which is a huge plus. I feel like you can literally enter your own quiet world in a busy space like an airport or aircraft, and for me that is everything.Overall:This headset is the marquee of excellent sound quality, unmatched comfort, and the best noise cancelling on the market. The headset looks great on your head and sounds even better than it looks. Bose does it again.",11/24/2023,AGFNIYBZ7EMW3CTBLV2E75KRRI3Q,1,129,Color: White Smoke
560,RK19PT2S7F9,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars My New Fav!!!,Josh L.,4,Only used for a few days but higher impressed already. First thing is that the sound is amazing! First pair of Bose headphones so my comparisons are with my previous Sony XM4s and my brief try of Airpods Max from my friend. Noise cancellation is amazing and I say slightly better than Sony but again this is the XM4 I used not the new XM5 so I had less of that white noise swoosh sound used in that mode. Transparency also impressive sounding natural and again a step above Sony but still believe Apple leads in both features. Now sound yes like the ability to custom EQ and played around for the sound and like it but Sony does have more presets and EQ bands and bass adjustments so wish Bose had more of that but still got the sound that worked for me. The headphones are also comfortable but wish they extended the headband just a little more and slightly bigger earcups but over a few days just had to break them in for my ears and get used to wearing them. Also great that they fold and the nice case and the new XM5 doesn't fold and bigger case so that's why I didn't upgrade from XM4. Another con is wired mode has to be with headphones on with battery so that's sort of new with wired supposed to work without power as backup. These still are now my main headphones and will for years but again updates for more EQ settings would be nice.,11/30/2023,AHJWDUM5GCWRL3FLEMJYU3WJ3OHA,1,3,Color: Black

Just to be clear, I still love these headphones.The Bose QC Ultra has a feature where if you take one earphone off your head, they auto-pause what is playing. I don't personally like this feature because sometimes I don't want to pause when I take one cup off my head. I would rather always press a button.A second small gripe I have is that these earcups are a bit more hard than previous iterations. I have a pair of QCII's and I much prefer the soft comfort of those earcups to the slightly more firm padding on the QC Ultra.The final thing is the volume control. I am not a fan of touch controls and they have decided to go with a touch slider on this iteration. If my hand is a bit sweaty, it will stutter along the surface for inconsistent volume control. I would rather have physical buttons.Other than these small things, this set of headphones is superb.

571,R24OH3OV4FVA1T,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Noise-Cancellation and Sonic Bliss,P.O.,5,"The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are a game-changer. As an avid music enthusiast, frequent traveler, and love of movies in a loud and busy household, these headphones have improved my audio experiences in ways I never knew were possible.First and foremost, the noise cancellation is unparalleled. The moment you put these on, the outside world fades away. However, it still offers the ability to be aware of your surroundings when needed without stoping your audio. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment.Comfort is another standout feature. In my use case, I am wearing the headphones for prolonged periods of time, and most of the time you almost forget you have them on. However, the new head-on detection is really cool. The moment you slip the headphone of your ear, your entertainment pauses, and then when it is back in place, your entertainment seamlessly starts back up.If you are traveling you don't need to worry about the headphones going out on you, because the battery life is incredible. As with all Bose products the craftmanship and quality is top-notch. I have been hesitant to purchase Bose headphones in the past because I just didn't think that I would be able to tell enough of a difference. I was wrong.Overall, you will not be disappointed with these headphones, the only minor issues that I have run into are the fact that Bose utilizes two different apps to control their devices, so I was previously using Bose Connect, and the headphones require Bose Music. And although you don't really need the app once you have set them up, it would be nice to have that experience streamlined. I have also noticed that sometimes a new blue-tooth pairing can be a little finicky, but overall is very good.I am beyond excited to have these headphones, and it has added so much to my entertainment enjoyment.",11/18/2023,AGVE2CUYS4QEWISNATJ422HF3BIA,1,6,Color: Black

Not in terms of the build and sound but also comfort and portability. I was using qc45 for a few weeks but when this one was released, I thought I should buy this one instead.Now It arrived and I tried. I have used it for a few days. Here are my thoughts.1. It is a solidly built headphones. There is no question about the quality and that premium feel.2. Sound is a bit better than qc45, sony xm4, and xm5 (yes, I have tried those as well). Immersion audio mode is excellent.3. Confort is where it didn't work for me. I use headphones for long hours for work. And I need something that sits on my head without causing too much ear pressure or the pressure on my eyeglasses. But this one does. The clamping force is enough to cause discomfort in approximately 30 minutes.So my recommendation is that first try them before you buy them. :)",01/11/2024,AHEUCKCVZE5X74LKAEMQ7VZLQCRA,1,15,Color: White Smoke

This model's delay is long enough that you aren't sure if it registered the press. 2: The touch-slide volume control zone is located on the bottom of the right ear cup and is very picky.

Not what I expected. Im deciding if I want to keep them or find another option. I found out the hard way when the battery died and there was no sound. I don’t want to use bluetooth since the primary use for me is nighttime and bluetooth isn’t good to have all night on your head. Why can’t you find good wired portable phones anymore. They are very comfortable and besides the power problem exactly what I wanted. I don’t want bulky studio phones. Still looking.

581,R1UBAW5TTECVII,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Gone is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Quality of Yesteryear - Made in China,watch collector,3,"Made in China for BoseI was disappointed to replace my very old Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones, but they performed so long and so well, I decided to give Bose another go. Here’s what I experienced before returning them the next day:- The Bose app’s main use was toggling through the three listening modes. It has few features and is annoying to use each I need my headphones. Lose the app.- Pairing with iPhone15 pro max was simple. After that, the headphones refused to pair with other devices—permanently—repairing was constantly required, even with my many other Bose products- Function buttons on the right earpiece are difficult to find and easily activated with unintentional touches. It’s hard to say which is worse, the app or the analog function keys. I have large hands so finding and using the tiny main button and even smaller bluetooth buttons was challenging.- Saving the worst for last, and this very likely was a factory defect, but the maximum volume of these headphones is lower than my small ipod pros! A strange volume control bar on the right earpience is a bit sluggish, but the problem my set had was volume that would not go past “medium” on most other headsets.- I eagerly await Apple’s AirMax headphones.",03/22/2024,AG2ELZHO6QIAYX7DQ7OMQZPD5ZCQ,1,3,Color: Sandstone

583,R3KJKK9AX9OOLI,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Top of the line,Kristen,5,"I needed some quality headphones for a few different reasons. I road trip a lot with children and needed some quiet time to get some work done, and my husband works in an office where he is constantly doing virtual meetings. These headphones have made both of these things a huge upgrade! The different modes are helpful as well. In the car I had on ""aware"" mode and was able to hear if my kids were asking me for something but could not hear that my husband had some music playing on the radio pretty loud. So crazy how you can hear one thing but it completely blocks out another!I wanted to learn more about the immersion mode so I downloaded the app. I usually don't like downloading an app for every product I have, but the demo was so useful and it explained how immersion mode works and OH MY GOSH it is so cool, it really makes you feel like you are actually seeing someone perform live.We had some confusion connecting them and learning to switch back and forth between different phones at first but it does get easier. The fact the headset only has two buttons makes it a learning curve at first to remember how many times to push the button for answering calls, ending them, skipping forward a song, skipping backward, etc gets a little confusing but once you have it down its hard to forget. My husband said they work really well for his business calls and he can hear clearly and his co workers can understand him very well. Only complaint would be I found they put too much pressure on my head that I could not adjust away. I was constantly pulling a side up to relieve the pressure, so long term use isn't for me but I was the only one that tried them in my family that had this problem. Otherwise they were quite comfortable! Overall I am very happy with this purchase and plan to use these for work and for fun for quite a while.",10/24/2023,AEP2PIDEKJGG5Q7D7H2L3DX2NZ2A,1,9,Color: Black
584,R2Y20XIDR1S3X6,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Maybe the best noise cancelling but falling apart after 4 months,Scott B,4,"Update #2: Bose support is sending a complimentary award cushion replacement kit, which I wasn't aware existed, and is normally $34. I guess these cushions fall apart after some use and you've got to be extra careful with them. Keep that in mind if you expect ruggedness. 4 stars overallUpdate: it doesn't really matter how good the noise cancelling is if the things don't last, and both of the cups are falling apart after 4 months (see attached image). By contrast, I Sony's lasted several years without any major issues. I've tried contacting Boae support but they do not make it easy to contact them. It's kind of a joke for what I paid for th3se headphones that they are falling apart in less than 6 months.I've had the Sony WH-1000XM4 for a few years now and compared side by side, these Bose are significantly quieter. I tested various things like A/C units, loud neighbors, fans, music and these simply block a lot more noise. I don't know how these compare against the WH-1000XM5, but online reviews say the Bose have better noise cancelling, and that was enough to make me switch to Bose this time. Comfort, connection, battery and less important stuff to me seem good so far, so I'm happy with this purchase.",11/5/2023,AFHI3W5K6BXRQ6GFNPK2FT7JGPCQ,1,4,Color: Black
585,RYBJT9VECW33B,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones for the money,Rob,5,"I purchased these headphones and another competitor brand and style (Sony) to compare performance. The Bose had crisper and clearer sound as well as the perfect amount of bass vs the Sonys.Noise cancelation was amazing. I laid down on my bed to relax with the Bose on quiet mode. I shut my eyes and a few minutes later I was jolted by my daughter trying to talk to me. When I took the headphones off I realized that she opened my door, walked into the room and up to the bed and began speaking to me and subsequently yelled at me. It wasn't until she physically touched me that I knew someone was in the room with me. Most definitely amazing noise cancelation.As for listening to music for long periods of time these performed great and did not cause any discomfort to my ears. After a few minutes you don't even feel that you are wearing headphones.These fold up easily and store perfectly in the included case. I tried a week of the Bose and a week of the Sonys and the Bose are the clear winner in my opinion. I would most definitely recommend and I'm very happy with these for every day use.

586,R1M1D37NWQU1NK,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Not the sound profile for me- vocals felt subdued,david,3,"A subjective review, I mainly listen to ballades, classical, krnb/kpop, jazz… so i prefer somewhere close to the harman curve.I own hd 800 s and the airpods pro 2nd gen. I wont compare them to the 800 s because the price difference.Comfort- no complaints 4.6/5. Just got a bit warm due to me playing at higher volume because i want to hear vocals.Sound- some people say that its loud and some people say its quiet. I realized why people say this. Vocals are quiet, and almost become less present/more muddy when the volume is turned up. for me, the dip in the lower treble/high mid bothered me extremely, the sole reason im returning them. I prefer there not to be a dip there so that vocals are more present. For example the airpods pro 2nd gen/hd 800 s do a much better job at this region. And even though i tried to eq through bose app, it did not fix the dip present in the vocals. If you like to to listen to ballades, jazz, or anything with a lot of singing and instruments, i wouldn’t recommend them for this reason. The airpods pro 2nd gen have much better tuning sadly. If you dont listen to vocals or dont care if they are prominent you might like these. 2.5/5Connectivity- i like that you can connect to two devices at once, it worked smoothly. 5/5Packaging-sucked, ugly box, not that it matters.Anc- quite good, 5/5Immersive audio- horrible compared to what apple has going on, not to hate. There is a crazy delay when using the motion mode, and still mode lowers sound quality, so its useless. 0/5Value- uh i think 2.5/ 5 its good for its anc, though i think anc has gotten good across the board, so I dont really care.Style -4.5/5- i find them to look niceTldr: don't like the tuning.

587,ROM93HGP49ETL,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars A great successor for my QC 35,LouRevue,5,"I've had the QC35 for years now and it's always been my go-to headset. For all-around purposes, the QC35 was the best for both music, conference calls and phone calls. I have a pair of Sony MX3's that I use for music since it has a little more bass to them than the QC35 but, overall, the QC35 was my favorite. That said, it's almost been 4 years now and it's starting to show some wear and slowly dying on me. Time for a new headset so I went for this new QC Ultra and I'm more than satisfied with this one.Music wise, it's better than my Sonys. I did have to tinker around with the EQ a bit but I did manage to get a setting that I really like so I may just need to retire my Sonys too. For conference/phone calls, this thing is great. Easy to pair with my home/work laptops and sound and voice clarity is crystal clear.The big thing was the updated ANC. It's much better than the QC35 and the immersion setting it fantastic. Really makes the sound come through clear without any weird distortions or anything.Fit/form, these actually fit a little better than the Qc35s did. They're a big more snug, in a good way, and don't get as loose as the QC35 did. The older style buttons have been replaced with more streamlined buttons and there is a volume slider neatly integrated behind the right ear cup. Battery life is supposed to be around 24 hours but we'll see how that goes.Overall though, a really nice upgrade from the QC35. I will miss those headphones but this is a great successor to those hands down.",12/11/2023,AEHVT32CLFMTXHYZ3QLYKP5W6TAA,1,4,Color: Black

589,R1GJYGGW89PVXO,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Sleek comfortable Headphone with Multipoint,Normal Consumer,5,"I've owned many headphones, earbuds, and a few noise-cancelling over-the-ear headphones like this Bose one. By far, this is the best looking and comfy headphone that I've used. I love that it features auto-on and power-saving mode when putting it on and off, so I don't have to worry about keeping it on and coming back to a dead battery. Bose's noise-cancelling headphones are known to be popular amongst those who travel frequently in the airplane rides, and while I haven't had a chance to test this in the airplane yet, it completely blocks out ambient noises like my AC running, neighbor's lawn mower, etc. Without any music playing, I'm able to hear my family conversing in the same room, but still works well. New feature called the immersion mode, is quite cool. It makes the sound more hollow as if you're in a bigger space, so that it feels more like it's coming out of the space you're in. The head-tracking mode is super interesting as you turn your head, but I don't think I'll use that feature much. My favorite part of this headphone is the multipoint. It lets me connect to both my laptop and my phone, and depending on which source is playing sound, I'll be able to hear without having to disconnect and reconnect. I wish all bluetooth audio devices supported this feature! As shown in the photo where it's folded up, I feel like a pouch might be easier to store instead of the zippered case that came with it. While it does a great job of storing it, having to align the orientation to make it flat takes some time getting used to. My head's circumference is about 59.5 cm and I have to extend the headphone all the way to fit my large head but I imagine it'll work well for most people with average head size. I'd say the headphone is definitely on the pricy side, but it's definitely a premium device that many will enjoy using.",11/2/2023,AFKNSDC6PPBLSXII6YLA5GBXOXJQ,1,28,Color: Black

Again, it was too much and made me sick.Wore them for one Teams meeting and one Zoom meeting. The microphone was excellent and did block outside noise when I was talking. I asked people in the meeting how I sounded and they said perfectly.If you can handle the intensity of the noise suppression and need excellent noise cancellation and microphone, these are for you and will be worth the money.If you get motion sickness easily, I caution you on these as they may do the same (make you dizzy and sick).Overall: Amazing noise cancellation.",05/2/2024,AEVSDYHHW6QO3J636GT2TRJGE77Q,1,1,Color: Sandstone

Overall, the sound quality is great. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't describe the quality of the sound better than that. They just sound great lol. They're comfortable and very easy to connect to devices. They also have an app you can use to tweak the sound with an equalizer. I just use them flat because that seems like the most accurate representation of the audio source to me. Also, the battery lasts a really long time. I keep thinking ""alright, I should charge"", press the battery status, and it's only like 30% down. Kind of pricey, but it seems like anything audio related is just expensive after a certain point.

600,R1AC58E4VI0C2P,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Music to my ears!,DDAY,5,"I just received these Sennheiser Momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago. I bought them for $270, and now I see you can get them $20 less. I made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on Amazon simply because I have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. Such as often times when it comes to Bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. In my case, that was the case. The firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and I was off and running. I have owned, and sold several headsets, from JBL, Beats, SkullCandy, Sony and yes, Bose. Now, for me, and how I like my music to sound, the Sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding Bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. Mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. Wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! The lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. The Sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. Touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. Yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. Comfort. These cans are extremely comfortable. Even for my large head. Ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. Could it use more cushion? Maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. Weight. Yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! The cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. And that is something I can appreciate. Are these cans perfect? They are as close to perfect that you will get (IMHO) on Bluetooth headsets. Are there better cans out there? Sure, If you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. Even Sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. Of course they will sound better.One thing I didn't discuss is noise canceling. They get the job done in fine fashion. I have tried the Sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the Senn 4s. I have made several phones calls, FaceTime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! I am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how I sound, or, how the other end sounds. Lastly, battery life. It claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. That is a fact, as I have tested that claim and 59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge. Mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.Accessories. Well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. You will need a dongle (I purchased one from Amazon) and they sound great. It will sound different, and you may need to adjust you equalizer. The case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type C cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to movies or music that the plane is playing. And it all is neatly stored within the case.Final thoughts:I honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on Amazon is these headsets have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. Perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? Not sure, all I know is mine cans fired right up, and I did the update straight away. These cans have Bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. Yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. Much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. It may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle, but once you do, it's a piece of cake.I decided to take a chance, I did my research outside of Amazon reviews, and watched the pros on YouTube, and that's how I ended up buying these. Big risk considering I am a world away. Give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.",06/30/2024,AFGWGUIMRTG4L3M52MRY7QDFRDIQ,1,4,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones. Until recently, I've avoided all BT/wireless headphones because they presented too much compromise for my tastes. Noise cancellation adversely effected audio quality and/or gave me a headache. Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.Here's what I found:In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s. Enjoy!",01/24/2023,AEZIPLEDJYRIGVJKWFWRH44LK4TQ,1,375,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
602,R2CIT7PKP36F3M,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound quality, great battery life. Noise cancellation is OK. Updates could make it 5/5.",Amazon Customer,4,"Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones & headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what ""Comfort calling"" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous ""Connected/Disconnected"" messages while listening on a different device.Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.",09/29/2022,AGUYYNC6G5RGNFL4HD6LXEB6JJCA,1,31,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
603,R1IVGTBWY7A3K4,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars First Sennheiser purchase, highly impressed!",Shara Simpson,5,"I obsessively researched before buying these Sennheiser Momentum 4s. I had it narrowed down to Bose QC Ultras, Sony WH-1000XM5s, or these. Ultimately it came down to sound quality for me. The quality and clarity of any music genre I tested it with was far and away superior to Sony or Bose. These don't have the absolute best ANC compared to those, but it's still top tier. If you are looking for a fully immersive, lost in the music type of experience with your headphones, Sennheiser is the way to go. And the battery life is absolutely insane! I've had these for 3 weeks with almost daily use (at least an hour a day but usually more) and I haven't had to charge them at all since the first initial charge - they are still sitting at 40%! Sennheiser says they should last 60 hours with ANC at half volume and that seems accurate. No other headphones come close to that kind of battery life. I really love the Sennheiser app as well, it's packed full of useful features. The EQ on these is fully adjustable using the app. I used the ""My Sound Check"" feature and created sound profiles for various genres of music and places of use, but you can also manually adjust the 5-band EQ. You can save each sound profile and even use the Sound Zone feature to have the headphones automatically switch to a different sound profile based on your location (ex. gym settings versus work settings). There is also a Bass Boost toggle if you want head pounding bass. I really like the two-tone look of these - I got them in white, but the headband is covered in a very nice textured tan fabric and the earcups are tan as well. They are extremely comfortable for hours of use at a time. The case is super sturdy and nice. I put a size comparison pic in this review with the case next to my Kindle - the case is large since the headphones don't fold. This makes them less than ideal for use when traveling because they do take up a lot of space in your bag. The first week of use, I did have connection issues. They would randomly disconnect from whatever music streaming service I was using at the time and I would have to reconnect. Thankfully that went away and I haven't had any further connectivity problems. I don't use these for phone calls so can't review the mic or call quality yet. Overall I think I made the right choice with these, and am extremely happy with my purchase. I would recommend to anyone!",06/29/2024,AFPBVELJBKTT3FYLFSJ7RHINHVFA,1,2,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
604,R27AA754NCZRA9,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good on paper, bad on my head",Sam,3,"I was going back and forth between Sony WH-1000XM5 (XM5) and these headphones (SM4), and I decided to give these a shot since at the time of this purchase, I was able to get these for $279.83 before taxes while the XM5 are listed at ~$400 before taxes.On paper, the SM4 sounded great, double the battery life, supposedly better sound quality, and a not-so-shabby noise cancelling.However, after trying them for a week, I decided to return them. I will list the pros and cons below.PROS 1. Long battery life – I only charged it once during the whole week and it was still going strong. 2. Very solid construction – premium materials that feel good to the touch. 3. Pretty nice carrying case – feels solid and durable, and you don't need to fold the headphones when you put it in so it's simpler to stow in case. BUT I have to reset the positions of the earcups to fit into case, which means I have to always re-adjust to my head size before putting it on. 4. Great sound – I'm not an audiophile, but it sounded good. A friend said he picked up on more chords behind a Taylor Swift song that he hasn't heard before (he listens to Taylor Swift 24/7). 5. Sleek design – unlike the SM3, the SM4 has design that I like: minimalistic and modern.CONS 1. Subpar app-headphone interface – the app is glitchy, and I find myself wait around 10 seconds for the app to say ""connected"" to the headphones (even though the headphones are connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth); after which point, I can go in and change some settings. Also, I did have some stutters in the app that gave me an overall feel of unpolished. 2. Too heavy and too much clamping force – on paper, the weight and clamping force differs by 0.1-ish, but from trying out my friends' XM5s and my SM4, I feel a pretty noticeable difference in how hefty the headphones feel on my head. Simply put, SM4 feels tight on my head and XM5 feels like I can forget that I’m wearing them after a while—this is personal preference, but personally, SM4 felt less comfortable and a tad too heavy for long study sessions. 3. Headache-inducing noise cancelling – the noise cancel isn't as good as the XM5 indeed, but I think there is a bigger problem: the noise cancelling feels peculiarly headache-y. I have airpod pros, plus I have tried the XM5s, and I have to say, the SM4's noise cancelling is by far my least favorite. If I were to describe it, I would say it feels like the feeling I get from being on an airplane for 5+ hours with headphones on. All in all, I opted to have no noise cancelling on due to this uncomfortable feeling it gives me. 4. Touch control – the touch control is pretty responsive, but even if I touch the very edge of the earcups, it registers as a gesture, which gets annoying when I'm trying to adjust my headphones or taking them off for a second. After a few days, I almost wanted to turn them off. ALSO, XM5's cupping gesture to activate transparency mode is extremely desirable, especially since I'm a college student who finds myself studying with my friends a lot. AND the SM4 does not have a gesture to turn off noise cancelling; I have to either pinch in/out multiple times or go into the app and adjust the slider, and it gets very annoying quick.If you have read this far, I applaud your diligence to find the best headphones for you. Personally, I have ordered the XM5 and I will try it on and probably keep it. BUT, an advise for you if you are like me. I dug through the internet and have looked at countless written, video, and professional reviews of so many headphones, but I have to say, it all comes down to personal preference. You MUST go to a Best Buy, where they have headphones on racks that you can try on for yourself. Also, don’t be afraid to order them on amazon and try it out for a week and return them and move onto the next one. Amazon’s return policy is pretty good and if you use the headphones with care and keep the packaging that the headphones came in, you can most likely return them for free. I hope you find the right pair of headphones for yourself, reader.",02/3/2023,AE4ZGTN75KVUPUK7VO5OXU4BKWJA,1,119,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
605,R3C9NCI2LLQD48,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser vs Sony vs Apple,Calder Akin,5,"After watching countless hours of review videos and sampling multiple headphones firsthand I narrowed my final selections down to the Momentum 4’s ($280 currently on Amazon), and a pair of certified refurbished (eBay) AirPod Max’s ($390) and Sony Xm5’s ($280). My budget was under $400. I also considered the Bowers & wilkins px7 s2 but didn’t have a chance to try them out firsthand so I excluded them from my selection process.Ultimately I decided to go with the Sennheisers. To me the Sonys are the most comfortable (so light, it’s as if there’s nothing on your head!) but the ear-cup itself is the shallowest of the three- my ears stick out a little so this was a consideration. Also, I have an iPhone and many reviews said the audio was better on the XM5’s when connected to androids due to the Ldac etc. The Apples sound the best when it comes to immersive experience (spacial audio wow!) but the limited EQ flexibility, and the extra money I’d have to spend on a real case plus wires to plug into a jack when flying outweighed (no pun intended- but these things ARE heavy!) the luxury feel.The Momentum 4’s (M4) are very comfortable with plush faux leather on the ear cups. I wish they were a bit bigger of an oval shape (something to consider if you have big ears) but for me they fit just right. The ear cup has more substantial padding and recesses slightly deeper than the Sonys over the ear. All three of these headphones have the same sliding headband design which I really like.Where the M4’s really shine however is in the audio department. It just sounds so clean in my opinion. I own a pair of Beats Studio 3’s which are my go-to gym headphones. You don’t get a “pounding” heavy sound with the M4’s like you do with the Beats but that’s fine with me. They also don’t get as loud as my Beats but I didn’t buy them for either of these reasons. I wanted a pair of headphones for traveling, taking the dog for a walk, and listening to music/tv around the house. Speaking of watching TV with them, there’s an EQ preset through the app which is designed for podcasts. I set the headphones to this feature the other night while watching a basketball game and it sounded amazing! Also there’s this cool feature for phone calls which you can adjust through the app where it sounds like you aren’t wearing headphones and you can hear your own voice clearly - muffled sounding phone calls are a thing of the past!Overall I’m incredibly happy with my purchase. They aren’t quite as comfortable as the Sony’s- it’s not that they’re uncomfortable it’s just they have more weight to them and more of a clamp on the head. And they don’t have the seamless syncing ability and build quality of the Apples. Also, their noise cancelling and transparency mode is slightly below both. But for the price and sound quality these were the best fit for me.Pros:* price ($279 on Amazon currently which is around $70 below retail)* Clean, pure audio that sounds good regardless of your favorite genre of music.* Comfort- plush pads with ample space for my ears to be enclosed. Easily adjustable sliding headband.* Rigid case (slightly smaller than the XM5’s)* Battery life (60 hours!)* Auto-off feature when taken off and not used for 15 minutes or more depending on how you set it (great if you often forget to turn off your headphones!)* Easy to navigate app. I know some have complained about the app but I’ve had zero issues with it- maybe the firmware has been fixed with the most recent update?* No noticeable hissing sound with ANC.* 2 year manufacturers warranty* Usb-c and traditional 3.5mm connectivity. Also they come included with a two-prong airplane jack.Cons:* I appreciate the creativity making most of the functions of the headphones accessible via touchpad on the right ear-cup, but the pinching/expanding feature to adjust ANC/transparency is useless. Thankfully you can just double tap the headset to switch between these settings.* They don’t get super loud, well at least compared to my Beats, so I wouldn’t consider these a great gym option. (Edit: there’s a thread on Reddit that gives some pointers on how to increase the overall volume- especially if you have an iphone. Worth checking out, the adjustments I made did seem to work)* They aren’t water/sweat resistant, which is another reason not to wear them to the gym.* ANC is effective but not on the level of the Sonys or Apples.* The auto pause feature is pretty sensitive. Something to keep in mind if you adjust your headphones often during usage. If you lift them off your head, even to just change position the audio can unintentionally pause. (Edit: there’s a way to turn off this function in the app)TLDR; Best Bluetooth noise cancelling over ear headphones currently available.",01/27/2023,AGGIZAHMHFHO4J6OU7FMAHUD4MMA,1,154,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
606,R15B34B8ZDY89M,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and battery life with a couple comprimises,Grant Bohn,5,"If your priority is sound quality and battery life, these are the headphones to get. I listen primarily to electronic music and the bass is just right. It's clear and full, but not overbearing once EQ'd down a couple dB in the app. What you give up for this is comfort and ANC quality. These are not the sort of headphones you forget that you're wearing. They definitely have some heft to them and a higher clamping force than others. They do feel solidly built though. The ANC works well but from other reviews I've read, it falls a bit short compared to Bose and Sony's offerings. It's a give and take, but the momentum's deliver on fantastic sound and industry leading battery life if that's what you're looking for.",06/9/2024,AGE7TIJAE6AOGRW2PLXE2CTUAV3Q,1,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
607,R3HDZ4YGKNQ6L5,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Great Sound + Connection Problems + Poor touch controls,Ryan,3,"I just got these headphone. I really like how they feel and sound. The problem I have with these headphones is largely related to its bluetooth features and controls. I have these headphones connected to my phone and my TV. I live in an apartment. As such, these headphones constantly get confused between which bluetooth source to connect to. The result is choppy, broken audio or no audio at all and problems with touch controls.When its my phone's audio that's choppy the solution is to disconnect the tv using the headphone app. However, shortly after disconnecting the tv, the tv reconnects on its own and the problem returns. When its the TV audio that choppy, I have to turn off bluetooth on my phone completely to solve the problem. This again is due to the headphones automatically connecting to the unwanted source.The controls for this headphone are wonky to say the least and often don't work. For example, I will answer a phone call with a touch control but then can't end the phone call with a touch control. Another example is that I can't start or resume playing Spotify on my phone using touch controls. But while the music is playing I can pause, skip, or change the volume. I think some of these problems may be due to the headphones connecting to my tv at the same time. I suspect that my attempts to play or resume music are being sent to my TV (which is off) and not to my phone.The headphone's app is largely useless for attempting to solve these problems. The likely solution to all of these problems is to 'forget' my tv. Meaning, everytime I want to connect my headphones to my tv I would have to pair them with my tv. At this point, I'm likely to return these headphones due to all of these problems.To put all of the above in perspective. I have a pair of Pixel earbuds and I experience none of the above problems.",06/18/2024,AF4KKUJCDDGW4ZZLQN23QJMOYFCQ,1,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
608,R38QYC50V9S55Y,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Winner of my search for headphones,Chip chipperson,5,"I wanted to find a really good set of over the ear headphones to use at the office and for general use. I tried a few other highly rated models at varying price points. The momentum 4 was the winner for me. I had been using Beats Studio noise canceling earbuds and before that a pair of beats special edition solos. The solos hurt my ears after 2 hours, while the earbuds were great, but they just don’t last long enough for my current work environment without having to charge. Additionally, the earbuds had bad sound wuality for the microphones so they weren’t ideal for phone and teams calls.I orders the sennheiser as my higher end option to evaluate. At first I was a little skeptical of they were going to be the ones. I found that just pairing them to my iPhone worked and was easy, but it did t allow me to use the sennheiser app. I cleared them from my phones Bluetooth lost and paired again using the app, and all was good. The app offers a pretty decent amount of customization and guides you through it. I think the app works well once you get it all configured correctly. There are other headphones on the market that will really rattle your head with bass such as the beats and some of the skullcandy headphones. I found that I don’t care for those headphones when I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks, they are just too tuned for music with deep and solid bass. The momentum 4 delivers some very tight and punch bass. I can’t say I’m wow’d by the bass I get for every track I listen to, but when I get into a bass heavy track or album, I find myself completely wow’d by the performance and range of these momentum 4’s. I believe these are a truer representation of how most songs are actually recorded. The clarity, crisp, clean, tight, punchy, deep, and full sound from these headphones is fantastic. I think my podcasts sound great, music sounds awesome, across a very wide variety of genres. The clarity of my voice in a loud office setting to take phone calls and teams calls is great. The noise canceling is always on unless you adjust to transparency to some degree, and I would have expected this to hinder battery life, but these do a great job canceling ambient noise and fully live up to the claims of 60plus hours of use between charges.I wear these at a minimum 6 hours a day, sometimes as much as 10. They actually keep a connection far better than I expected. I have these paired to my work pc and my iPhone at the same time and can get up and move around our office and leave devices at my desk and never lose connection. While connected to two devices it does a good job seamlessly transitioning from one device to the other based on what apps or programs you are running.Last thing I can think to comment on are the headphone controls. The right earpiece is a touch sensitive pad that picks up on specific but very intuitive gestures. Pausing music, changing tracks, adjusting ANC and transparency, and volume is super easy. The only one of these I think is a little touchy is the volume control, which works fine but it seems a little inconsistent as to how much it adjusts each time. I’ve never had a situation where it was too sensitive and blasted me with sound unexpectedly.Overall, I do recommend these for the money. Like mine so well, I bought a pair for my wife as she was so impressed with mine as well.",04/4/2024,AEHRRPY3SLGEJSCWGWWY75QNAMUQ,1,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
609,R3CBBVTHO6OEW6,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love these...,Joe,3,"I own another pair of Sennheiser headphones, the 598SE's, and they're spectacular. They're spacious, clear, wonderful sound stage, light, and powerful.After trying a few other brands of ANC headphones, I learned about the Momentum 4's and immediately thought: OK, Sennheiser is gonna knock it out of the park.Unfortunately, they only got to first base.First, the good:I love how these look, especially the copper accented special edition's that I got. The fabric on the top of the headband makes it look classy.The sound is wonderful. Absolutely the best thing about this product. The sound stage compared to the other major competitors is still a step above.The carrying case is nice, roughly the same size as their competitors. I did wish it could have been a bit smaller (this goes for the competitors too).The swipe controls are the same as a major competitor, which you can also lock. I really like the swipe controls, though having physical buttons would be nice too, especially if you lock the swipe controls.The battery life is beyond spectacular. It destroys their competition and you could probably wear these for several days without needing a charge.Now, the bad:They're quite heavy. The weight on paper seems like they'd be fine, but while wearing them I quickly got fatigued and felt frustrated wearing them (while their competitors, it took much longer to get to that point).They get hot. Not the headset itself, but they form a seal on your head and you'll feel your ears cooking after a short while in a comfortable temperature room. This was another reason I frequently took them off.The earcups are small. They seem EVER SO SLIGHTLY larger than their competitors but... not enough. The 598SE's have big beautiful spacious earcups but these (and their competitors) are very cramped.The ANC is notably weaker in a perfect environment without noise playing than others. With others, I could barely make out any words while playing a song or video rather loud as a test. With the Sennheisers I could make out quite a bit of words and sound. The Momentum 4's have fewer ANC microphones than the competitors.The ANC also almost drops out completely if you have ""windy environment mode"" turned on, for some reason. (Note: I did not test them in a windy environment) If the ANC is important, make sure you have this setting *TURNED OFF* in the app.The app is ok, but what you can ""control"" seems finicky and sometimes its as if changing settings did nothing.The call volume is like 5 generations ago hands-free headset. Very poor quality. The person I tested them with said it sounded like I was outdoors or in a noisy environment when I was in a quiet room.The clamping is quite tight and becomes painful very quickly. It puts a lot of pressure around your ear which can become very uncomfortable. A friend said they loosen up after a couple days but mine stayed far too tight. It felt like a vice. [If it doesnt bother you, this could be a plus, as they seem like they will hold their shape and tightness for a long time]Even lacking almost any physical buttons, they basically threaten you to not get these wet. There is no waterproofing on these. Handle with care.The rest:These are by no means a ""bad"" set of wireless ANC cans, and the price is good, especially if you can get them on sale. If you're just going to be using them in the office or on a commute, they'll probably be fine, especially if you dont want to dole out extra cash for a minor upgrade in ANC. The middling ANC was quite disappointing, but if you have some sounds playing while its on, it works together to make most noises disappear. Unfortunately, sometimes I want to be able to just block out the world, and the Momentum 4's were just not up to the task compared to others.I was really hoping the earcups would be larger and more similar to other Sennheiser headsets I've tried/owned, but they seemed to want to copy the competition, which is a shame. If the cups were larger and the clamping a bit less harsh, I would have accepted their flaws and gone with these. With the laundry list of negatives, you can probably tell why I didnt.Also please note: I am a big guy, and I probably have a larger than average head. This could be contributing to the clamping pressure.Listening to anything on these was a treat. Everything sounded beautiful. Other brands should take a few notes on Sennheisers drivers.I had two main requirements: comfortable ear cups (failed) and long battery life for an upcoming flight (wow did these pass with not flying colors but to outerspace and back colors!). Unfortunately, as they were just not at all comfortable (I could wear my 598SE's for days and not even realize they're there). Their long battery life did not offset the negatives.This may all not be true for you. They definitely stand out and are far more attractive than the competition (at least, the special edition versions are). I am definitely biased towards Sennheiser as I have loved so many of their headsets, but found these disappointing in far too many areas. A few design tweaks could have made these one of the best over the ear cans on the market. As is, they're probably ranked 4th imho.",12/4/2023,AHECMYUWUWYVG4EVIGA4QI6LUO4A,1,6,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

Safe to say, they aren't the most noise canceling headphones you can get. So when I went looking for a new pair of wireless over-ears, I had a lot to choose from. I didn’t want sony so that was out of the question.I had whittled it down to four pairs.AirPods MaxBose Quietcomfort UltraSennheiser Momentum 4’s andSonos Ace.Now each of these had their own strengths and weaknesses.AirPods Max are realistically only compatible with apple products and have the worst battery life. However have the same sound signature as my current AirPods.Bose Quietcomfort Ultra has the best noise canceling of the bunch, but was more expensive and ultimately poor battery life.Sonos Ace is the newest one of the bunch, it has decent audio quality and an okay battery. The worst was the microphone, I did not want to have to deal with a microphone that low quality.Which brings me to the ones I went with.Momentum 4 has some of the best soundstage I’ve heard in headphones. The bass is punchy but doesn’t muddy the rest of the track. The touch controls are personally a hit or miss, I love most of them but wish I could pinch or un-pinch to turn transparency fully on or off respectively.

It meets my needs.The noise cancellation is much stronger than my old $120 Sony headphones, and the battery lasts roughly three times as long -- upwards of 60 hours. The audio pass-through feature is also great for those times when you need to listen to your surroundings.I enjoy the style as well. The white/beige color stands out among bluetooth headphones, I think.I've only two complaints: 1) My head is on the larger size, and these are a tight fit. They do break in after awhile (I'm posting this after around 9 months of use), but they still clamp a bit too hard for my liking, and can run hot. Should not be a problem for most people, I think. But for larger headed folks, be aware of what you're getting into. I'm willing to make the compromise for headphones of this quality, though. 2) the headphones have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I find this feature isn't worthwhile. When I'm listening to music through my tablet, and I get a text alert from my phone, there's a staticky sound that just makes it not worth using. That said, I haven't had the other software issues that some users experience. As far as I can tell, Sennheiser has patched it all up -- my experience has been smooth.",06/10/2024,AH2PJ2BKE72VH5SVUL7TI6ZMXXXA,1,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
612,R2LPTVUEFSY1JF,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Best ANC Headphones with incredible sound in 2024,Govind Mittal,5,"I have been using Sony WH - 720 n since past year (2023 to 2024) and I was looking to upgrade my headphones. The picture shows comparison with sony 720n. I tried Sony ULT wear (too bassy), Beats Pro (too flat sound signature), Sennheiser Accentum (good but sound quality wasnt best), Sony WH 1000 XM4 (instrument separation wasnt bes). I have Airpods pro 2 but I also wanted a headset as the sound staging of headset is better.Let me address all the cons that you might have heard from youtube influencers. All the cons like headset automatically powering on while in case, auto pause not working etc are gone with latest software update (Software rev 2.13.28)Pros:The sound of Sennheiser momentum 4 is clean with impressive instrument separation and bass that both hits and resonates. The sound staging is shockingly well. For some tracks, it feels they are being played live in front of me. The sound is loud enough for me. I keep them around 70% as I dont want to miss out on all of that intstrument separation!the case, although bigger than sony ULT wear/1000xm4 and bose QC but its not as big as sony 1000 xm5 or other headset that dont fold. Refer to the pic. Because of impressive sound, I am willing to compromise a little on the case size.Impressive ANC. The world goes super quite. I cant hear my keystrokes when I am typing, no hum of AC in the background (my home office is very close to AC unit). Touch controls are bit sensitive but its not bad. You get used to it.I purchased them at $280. So its a steal. I would not buy them at $379. They dont feel premium enough to justify $379 price tag. They do live up to $280 price tag. Not super premium, but not cheap looking by any means.60 hours battery life!The clamping force isnt as tight as its on other Sennheiser headsets like 450 BT or Accentum. Its bit tighter as compared to Sony WH 720 n though. The earcups do seems to get a little hot after a while and I have to let heat out and adjust them a little.Cons:Not perfect for travel due to big case. But I still manage.Def less comfortable than my sony wh720nIf they go on sale for $279 or lower, get them!

613,R246JYYUL9YOYE,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing battery life, sound quality, and ANC.",Joseph Oscar,4,"I've figured out the bug people seem to run into which is the headset does not output sound. They're onand connected but no music. In my case, it's when an app. is activated for VOIP. I'm currently using the Nextiva phone app to answer calls when I walk away from the desk and when I receive a phone call, I have to force close the app to get music rolling again. Once music is playing, I can open the app again to catch the next call. It's a buggy back and forth but I have it figured out at least. Current phone is Google Pixel 7 Pro. So if anyone else reads this, try force closing whatever secondary app you use for VOIP.I just wanted the main issue to be the first eye catcher but with the headphones working and the equalizer set from the app, these things rock. If I'm working on a car with the ANC turned on, I can barely hear the air compressor running in the background. A little but it's reduced significantly. Now the ear cup material will make you sweat if your in a warm environment so make sure your aware of that. It's not that bad really. I'm sure when it gets warmer out, it will be more noticable. Probably not a good workout headphone either. That I can't comment on. I have to many excuses to go to the gym 😅.Battery life is great. Rated 60+ hours and it definitely is there. I use my headset daily with ANC moving all over the place with whatever I'm doing and music running all kinds of volume levels. I definitely don't charge these very often but get over a week depending on usage. 4-8 hours a day thoughout the work week.Sometimes, the in ear sensor that tells when the headset is on will think I've removed the headset and turn off. I'll just have to push the right side head cup in and it will read again and turn back on. Kind of annoying but I think I need to reach out to Sennheiser about that.Fingure controls, super easy and very responsive. Once you've used the headphones a few times and read the instruction sticker that comes on the headphones, it's muscle memory from there. Your off doing your own thing swiping, pinching and pressing your fingers around using the functions.

615,RL3M28E80KTYV,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality, solid in every other area",Aaron,5,"Bought these along with the Sony XM5 to compare to my existing Bose 700.Comfort:The Bose 700 I don't find very comfortable, namely the headband, being rather thin, it puts pressure on the top of my head after a couple hours. The Sony had this problem initially, but then I started loosening the headband as much as possible, and being a very light pair, I stopped having that particular issue. All in all I found the Sony much more comfortable than the 700. I could see some folks saying it's more comfortable than the Momentum 4s. However I disagree about that. For me the Momentum 4 are the most comfortable. It has very soft ear pads, much like the Sony. Granted the M4s are heavier, but the weight is distributed very well across the headband, better than the Sony's imo. All in all, it's a close call and the Sony's are really well done comfort wise. Super light and super cushy pads. Could see a reasonable person going in either direction for the win here.Sound quality:I think the XM5 are pretty close to the Bose 700 and could see folks going either way depending on your signature preferences. Personally think I like the Sony a bit better, just more lively than the more neutral Bose. Both are in the same league though. The M4s are way better sound quality wise plain and simple. They're not in the same league. Heck, they're not even playing in the same sport. Find myself listening to music way more often during the day simply because I enjoy it that much more. This is the reason I'm ultimately sticking with the M4s. And it's not a hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 are simply the best. If you're buying headphones to block out the sound of your partner playing annoying tiktok vids, this is the one to get. M4s have pretty good noise canceling too, but the Sony's are way better here imo. Bose sits between the XM5 and the M4s, maybe just a little better than the M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely with multiple meetings throughout the day so I've done extensive testing on all three models. In a nutshell if you don't have any special requirements, all of them do a great job. In quiet conditions I prefer the the M4 a little better than the others, my voice just has more body to it, but again, it's plenty clear using any of these models. In noisy conditions, the Sony XM5 are way better than the rest in isolating your voice and minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! The 700 and M4 handled the background noise a bit differently. My voice is clearer on the M4s in noisy conditions whereas the Bose cancel out more background noise at the cost of sacrificing clarity. When there's lots of noise, the Bose can reduce your voice to the point where it's super difficult to hear what you're saying. The M4s will allow more background noise through, but my voice remains super clear and louder than other sounds coming through.One feature I really like about the M4s, the one and only button they have (making it super easy to find) becomes a mute button during calls, zoom or google meetings. Really enjoy that feature as I could walk around the house and unmute myself if I need to talk. A voice tells you if it's muted or unmuted so you know where you're at. No more flushing the toilet while running out of the room hoping no-one on the meeting heard it.The background noise canceling of the XM5 during calls was so good, it made me really want to keep them. But ultimately good music sound quality is something I'd enjoy more often since I'm not often taking meetings in super noisy conditions. Also the M4s have the mute button I could use if I do find myself in that situation.Summery:If you want incredible noise cancelation while listening to music, taking calls or meetings, the Sony XM5 are the one to get. They are head and shoulders above the competition in this respect. If you wanna be wowed by how amazing your music sounds, renewing your love for music you didn't even know you had, the M4s are for you. These are the main areas where there is substantial difference. Sony and Seinheiser truly impressed me in their respective areas of expertise. Aside from those standout areas, these are all great headsets. Even the Bose 700 is a really solid headset. Unfortunately it wasn't able to differentiate itself when compared to these two titans of industry. Noise canceling is great, just can't touch the Sony's. Sound quality also great, just can't touch the M4s. Arguable the Bose are the slickest looking headset of the bunch though.",09/20/2022,AEIK33PCH7JB7R3OI4CZJZPPNLDQ,1,88,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

For some unknown reason, the on-headset gesture controls did not work until I walked into the room containing the AV Receiver. After that, the headset is performing as advertised.

They also tend to slide forward if you are moving around a lot.A major issue I've had with these is for desktop/laptop use. I'm not sure if this is a computer-related issue but both on my Windows 11 laptop and Windows 11 desktop, the headphones will randomly stutter (headphones are updated to the latest version 2.13.28). Checking online and this seems to be a pretty big issue that has still not been patched.Apart from these issues, these are amazing headphones, I do hope Sennheiser fixes the computer audio problem",06/7/2024,AES7KETRMYYF6KZDY6Q5RDLENIQA,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
618,RQIJ8796C2B2A,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Sound is top notch,NerdyCup,4,"TLDR; great sound with pretty good ANC.First, I'm not an audiophile. I appreciate music and sound more than just ""MOAR BASS"" but as to warmth, tonality, and terms like that, I'm lost. I do know having worn open back headphones those have a great sound space compared to closed back, but my wife can't stand hearing my music so it's closed back headphones for me.Positive:1. Great sound. Between these, some Senns 598s, true momentum earbuds, I've never not liked the sound Sennheiser produces. Earbuds were the weakest, but those were Momentum 2s and didn't last long when my dogs chewed on them (I understand Sennheiser has improved as well).1A. I cannot understate how good these sound - I literally can hear Chester Bennington pushing his breath out on ""Lost"", and instruments I've never picked up before. I can't recall other headsets doing that for me.2. Comfortable - immediately comfortable out of the box. Maybe warms up my ears a bit much, but the benefit is a solidly closed ""box"" for my ears to listen without distraction.3. Battery life appears to be as epic as they say it is. I haven't rocked it solid for 50+ hours to find out but I've charged it like once, when I first got it a few weeks ago (not constantly listening)Unknowns: need to test the ANC on an airplane/airport setting, which is my biggest pet peeve for noise environments. Will try to update (if I remember) once I do.Negatives:1. Touch controls in general. It's not just Sennheiser, but Sony and others im sure. I just don't really want to take the time to remember if it's a swipe, pinch, double-triple-quad tap to do something. KISS should be the rule of thumb. I can stumble through by tapping/swiping either side and eventually find something close to what I want, but I usually end up in the Sennheiser Smart Control App to make sure the ANC is what I want.Comparison:I also got a Sony WH-1000XM5 recently. Also a very good headphone, but the sound is absolutely not as good as Sennheiser. ANC is top of class though (although I also have t tried it in an airport/airplane, just in my commutes), and is better than Sennheiser, it's not as huge a gap as it used to be. We're comparing a Porsche and a BMW; should anyone turn either of them down? No.It comes down to your personal needs: lots of travel(air, train, whatever) in noisy environments? Maybe go with Sony, but I'd try the Sennheiser Momentum 4s first to see if their ANC works for you. IMO, the Sennheiser sound quality is much better than Sony's sound more than Sony's ANC is better than Sennheiser's.",02/26/2024,AGX5BT3OBJ4RMSQM7TVVOBQTPU4Q,1,4,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

Comparing it to earbuds, it’s a completely different experience.

620,R3V8FW19HBYSG7,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't touch them or they'll try to connect to everything,Customer Since 1997,3,"These headphones must have some kind of tilt sensor or other mechanism to know when they have been moved. If I am not using them and I accidentally touch them or they get bumped and move even slightly, they will suddenly try to connect to every device they are paired with, cutting off the sound from a random device I'm not currently using them with. They also seem to just randomly connect themselves to any device that is playing audio, cutting off the sound so that I have to go to that Bluetooth device's settings and disconnect them to get sound back. Very annoying.That aside, these are what I would call 'average' headphones. They're your typical V-shaped consumer sound that you'd get from any other dynamic headphone. They're bass heavy because your average consumer equates more base with more quality.Their noise cancellation is not particularly good. They seem to slightly lower the volume of some noises. In the areas where other noise canceling headphones excel such as repetitive or droning noises, these headphones seem to not work at all. For example, when I'm a passenger in a car I can clearly hear the noise of the air conditioner with the noise cancellation maxed out.There's also a problem with the touch surface on the earcup. I have turned off the touch features several times but they keep turning themselves back on. Every time I touch my face to scratch an itch or brush my hair out of my face I hear a PLOK and a random setting on the headphones has changed itself as if I have interacted with them. I have to dig my phone out in the middle of my exercise, figure out which setting was changed, and change it back.That's not to say that these headphones are all bad: I have tried many of the headphones in the ""fancy wireless headphones with noise canceling"" category over the years, and I'd have to say that in terms of comfort, these are the best. I can wear them for hours while exercising with minimal discomfort.That said, they do have some rattling and creaking issues that I would not expect at this price point. There's an unusual amount of plastic material on these headphones that I would not expect on a premium noise canceling headphone. While other brands are using lovely brushed aluminum supports for the earcups, these headphones have stuck with the creaky plastic with clearly visible mold lines.To summarize, I would say that these headphones are sort of the odd person out: They do not excel at anything, but they are not particularly bad at anything, either. Senheiser seems to have targeted to produce a headphone that provides middle-of-the-road performance in all areas, and in that capacity they have succeeded.",05/16/2024,AER3H6YXKFEFRVUVRRMSWOQFE42A,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Firstly, the connection gets choppy sometimes, and I don't know why. It often requires restarting the headset to fix. Another issue is that the quietest volume is not quiet enough. Listening to music in bed at night, it's just too loud in such an otherwise quiet environment. Also the auto-off/wake feature is way too sensitive. I'll leave it on my desk, come back later, and just bumping the desk makes it turn back on which often I don't want. Also if I manually disconnect the headset BT connection from my phone, the headset will just reconnect after a few seconds which is really annoying.",05/27/2024,AEL3ADX56NWIHHUCZKWI7N6FDU5Q,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
622,R2U81MBUB3SIOG,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Momentum 4 vs. everything else,AC,5,"Note:I am a trained listener - first as a former musician, second as an engineer, and lastly as a military operator.Devices used for testing/review:Samsung S22 Ultra (*disclaimer: Samsung owns Harman/AKG/etc., so their audio software is well above average)iPhone 12 Pro MaxApple Airpods MaxDragonfly Cobalt + USB C connector (for the wired headphones)Grado RS2eBeyerdynamic T1 v2Random air purifier on maxMusic tested:Houkiboshi by Younha (vocal, piano, guitar J-Pop song/anime soundtrack)Flash by Rocket Punch (standard K-Pop song)The The by Rocket Punch (dance K-Pop song)Wow by DIA ('new-retro' K-Pop song)Design overview:1. I purposely bought the white model - very clean/modern look, but perhaps a little too minimalistic. Also looks like many other competing wireless headphones ><.2. A little on the small side. I have fairly average-sized ears, and the earcups barely cover the lobes, which is great for passive noise cancellation, but I did have to adjust the headband quite a bit. In comparison, the Airpods have a self-adjusting system similar to my wired AKG K712 i.e., the headband will adjust to your head size.3. Plasticky compared to the Apple's metal frame. It's kind of like my AKG vs. my Beyerdynamic. In terms of build quality feel, 'you get what you pay for'.Comfort:1. Earpads: this is what most travelers will care about. Like with any headphone, I adamantly recommend everyone review manufacturer site, legitimate review sites, etc. The Sennheiser M4 has pleather pads as you can tell. No need to say that they'll get hot after a while - common knowledge. Grado loses here for obvious reasons, then the Sennheiser, then the Beyerdynamic, and finally the winner the Airpods. Apple was smart in using mesh - breathable and lightweight.2. Headband: this is not as big a deal as earpads. None of the test headphones were terrible, but some were still better than others. The Sennheiser uses a medium with pleather band covered by fabric, which looks nice. In a huge switcheroo, Grado wins with their thin industrial band, followed by Apple's thin metal, then the Sennheiser, and finally the Beyerdynamic with their high-end but a little too thick leather curve.Sound and Noise cancellation:1. Obviously, a wired headphone connected to a top end USB DAC will beat any wireless one, but both the Apple and Sennheiser did well here. And they still cost less than the Beyerdynamic to boot.2. Neither wired headphones are noise cancelling nor do they claim to be, but being semi-closed/open, you would think the Beyerdynamic might do ok, but no joy.3. Both the Apple and Sennheiser are very good at noise cancellation, but not perfect, but the Apple was clearly better, even with all Sennheiser settings at max.Accessories:1. This is a fun one. Apple being Apple, gives you jack (no pun intended). An USB C to Lightning cable, infamous bra case.2. Sennheiser, meanwhile, gives you an outdated (haven't seen these in years) airplane double connector, 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, USB C to A cable, and finally a nice cloth case (my color combo was gray).3. Additional note: wired headphones, being wired, both the Grado and Beyerdynamic gave 3.5mm to 6.3mm audio adapters. Being a high-end model, the T1 also came with a case.Final thoughts:1. I normally don't use wireless headphones, at most, a Bluetooth amp, the aforementioned USB DAC and one of my usual wired cans. But my brother convinced my to try a pair for an upcoming trip. They really are convenient.2. The unfortunate thing I found in my search, as of this writing (9/30/2022), there are no modern (i.e., BT 5) really high-end e.g., T1 level wireless headphones out there. They all seem to top out around the $400 mark, which sounds a lot, but not for a ultra high end wired headphone.3. Of the 10 or so better choices out there, what I would recommend depends on your music style, phone, use/need. Loyal Apple users - Airpods Max, Android users - this Sennheiser M4, hardcore must have the best music quality users - wait - niche uber manufacturers are getting there.",09/30/2022,AFZQEWUCJEY5NLQE6XQY3QQ5WC3Q,1,36,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

624,R15H50LMG3BLPJ,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars The premium headset to get,tlking4,5,"I've been looking to replace my Plantronics V8200 for years; I travel for work, take calls on both desktop and mobile, need a good microphone, often need solid noise cancellation, value comfort, and need convivence in charging, portability, and connectivity. The Momentum 4 checks all the boxes.Battery life is insane. Once charging cord (finally) is great. ANC is solid; no uncomfortable pressure or buzzing; and I took a flight while barely realizing we were on one.The folding and durability is nice and can easily carry these in a backpack with many other items. Extremely comfortable even for an 8hr session (and I wear glasses).I am far from an audiophile, but I have zero complaints about sound quality for calls, music, games, and movies. The in-app EQ is a good option. Mic quality is solid and have received zero complaints even on external customer calls.I was not expecting to like the touch controls. I do wish they were physical buttons, customizable, and on both earcups instead of just the right hand one. However, the actual experience (swipe up/down for volume, left/right for tracks, and tap to pause) is solid, with very few accidently presses. On-head detection worked perfectly. The physical button on the headset being a mute button while on a call is amazing, and this is detected in software on mobile (example being discord) and on desktop (WebEx mutes and unmutes itself in software when I press the button on the headset). This is amazing.The Multipoint connection (android phone and windows laptop) is very solid; notifications on the phone don't steal audio from a work call or vice versa. I do wish the headphone jack was a normal 3.5mm one instead of a smaller plug on the headset, then I wouldn't have to keep track of the adapter cord. Minor issue; very glad there is still a physical cable option along with the USB-C charging.Overall, this was the headset I was looking for and expect to run it for years.",04/8/2024,AHXNPP7TG2E73FWLT7L7PDVSH4XA,1,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

626,R3IPWB05P9IKRT,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best All Over Ear Headphones,Customer Ed,5,"I’ve tried many over ear and in ear headphones, including the Sony WH-1000xm4 and xm5, apple AirPods Max, and other Sennheisers. Simply put, these are the best. These have enhanced my enthusiasm for listening to new music, and I love listening to old favorites with all the luxurious, crisp detail these headphones can reproduce. I’ve broken it down into the most important features to me:Sound Quality: I’m not audiophile, but I can say these sound far superior to any of the other over ears I’ve used. Sennheiser is known for its neutral, accurate sound, and these seem to be the best iteration of that sound. Soundstage is wide open with incredible spatial effects, instrument separation, and no notable coloration or boxy sound. Despite the clarity, the bass here is incredible. You can feel it, but in a natural way that really underpins the song. Strong, natural base and incredibly detailed throughout the frequency spectrum, I can’t wait to get these things on my ears all day long. Just a pure joy of a listening experience.ANC - very strong. Not quite as strong as the Sony, but not enough of a drop down. You won’t notice much of a difference between these and any of the “better” ANC headphones. Same goes for the transparency mode, which allows you to hear ambient noise when you switch it on.Battery life - 60 hours is insane, but in my experience I’m getting that with ANC on so the claims don’t seem to be exaggerated.Comfort: definitely a little heavier than my Sonys, but buttery smooth headband and even weight distribution make for comfortable, long listening sessions. May be a bit of adjustment period if you’re used to lighter cans, but certainly not as heavy as the AirPods Max.Touch controls: definitely take some getting used to at first. Double tap right ear cup to enable ANC or transparency, pinch in or out to change noise cancellation level (this control is wonky and very hard to use, so I just use adaptive ANC and let it do its thing). Tracks can be switched by swiping left or right, but this can be an adventure. Depending on the angle that they’re sitting on your head, it can be hard to swipe in the exact right direction. With some practice it gets better. Same goes for up and down for volume, and volume changes seem to occur depending on the length of your swipe, rather than in steady increments. This means getting it to your exact desired volume using touch controls can be difficult. Answering and ending calls is also done through swiping forward and back, so you can experience the same issues. Overall, not the most intuitive controls, but not a deal breaker and with time it becomes easier.Call quality: I keep these on while working and take phone calls. Through some testing, these provide much better voice pickup and clarity than any of my in ears or even the built in speaker phone. If I’ve got an important call, I know the person on the other line will hear every word if I’m using these. Switching between calls, music, and podcasts with these all day long, these are perfect. They also have multipoint connectivity, providing seamless switching between laptop and phone.Overall, these are the best over ears I’ve found for what I use them for. Music, podcasts, commuting, movies and tv shows, work calls. The highest praise I have for these is they have revived my love of music as they remind you how good music can sound when reproduced with clarity and detail.If you’ve got some deep pockets, I’d also pick up the Momentum true wireless 3 earbuds, to have that same beautiful sound during those times that full over ear headphones aren’t appropriate.",12/22/2022,AGORAFANRG5DE6BQM4JS3ZO3EAQA,1,47,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

One of the few ANC wireless you can plug in and use wired. I prefer these over a few other much more expensive cans I’ve tried. Out of the box they sound bass boomy and slightly veiled - essy tweak via EQ. However for whatever reason after an hour or two they hurt my ears - not sure if it’s sonic or ear cup size and shape.",05/27/2024,AF2HFURXMWODMQPRLAYBZOTFPACQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
628,R1UEJPGVRZ9X65,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller cups than other Sennheiser - amazing anyway, read full review",George Fields,5,"You're a smart person, you can find the frequency response curves, ANC curves, etc. online. This review is about the overall experience. Note: I happen to LOVE the way these look, simple, plain, understated... smaller target for theft, too.I have the Sennheiser HD 515, HD 598, and HD 598 Cs, and the Sennheiser GAME ONE headset. Those (and most other from the brand) have large, extremely comfortable ear cups. I know that, and need that, because I used to play World of Warcraft for about 50 hours a week, with headphones all the time.First impression—the cups are smaller. It just so happens that I have normal ears, and the other Sennheisers I have are too big for me, with a good margin to adjust them when the skin gets tired around my earlobes. The MOMENTUM 4 surprised me by being smaller, but—they have a really good design and are concave, with more space inside the cup than it seems, especially in the back. I am able to find a few different positions where my earlobes are not pressed (or even touched) at all, but how they fit you will depend on your ears, which is something important to consider.The review at SoundGuys is on point. The M4 do have a bit more low end than my other sets, and I like that; it's easier to EQ your way down than up. Overall very happy with the sound, I don't think you'd be disappointed. As the SG review says, the ANC is a little weak sometimes; I don't care, to me that's secondary.Battery life is amazing, the 60hrs claim seems accurate. Build quality is plasticky and okay, I would baby them a bit. Touch controls are precise and responsive for me, even with the guide stickers still on the outside (which I've removed after my wife made fun of me for it). The app seems to work all right, I think it's better to set your preferences and then not use it anymore, as sometimes the settings get changed around a bit for no reason. (KEEP UP WITH FIRMWARE UPDATES, though.)Connectivity—outstanding. Bluetooth (multipoint x2), passive mode, and USB mode. Quickly: * Bluetooth: works fine. Good range, it seems. I don't care for or like the multipoint, and I think it's irrelevant. * USB mode: use USB-A to USB Type C cable (included). Headphone presents as a regular USB headset to the computer. Works great and charges at the same time. * Passive mode: Uses a 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable (included) to use as a plain Jane wired headset. You CAN power on the M4 in this mode and benefit from better sound, or leave them off (on purpose, or if the battery is dead). I DISAGREE THAT THE SOUND IS BAD IN PURE PASSIVE MODE, WITH POWER OFF. It's slightly subpar compared to BT/USB/powered passive, but it's JUST FINE, and pretty good to boot.The SG review docks the M4 on mic quality, but in my tests people's feedback was that the calls were clear and noise-free, even when I was doing yard work on a very windy day. Still, YMMV.Case—it's a carrying case. It's... functional, plain, the way I like my coffee.My only complaint, if this tells you anything—the charge port and 2.5mm port are on the RIGHT cup, whereas all other sets I've ever had or seen have the cable going to the LEFT one. The power button and touch controls are also on the RIGHT, so maybe that's why, but on the (infrequent) occasions when you may have a cable attached, it's not where you'd be used to finding it.",05/2/2023,AGORTA25R56MRPEW236JMI3XD25Q,1,111,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
629,R2DR9OKGN9HSJV,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wired Mode is sometimes totally bugged. Manufacturer defect.,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this pair about a month ago, and when i got it out of the box to explore the features, I noticed some serious issues; the bluetooth latency is terrible for gaming, and in wired mode (to reduce latency), sometimes the sound is ruined.I'm a gamer, and I like to play a lot of PUBG, so I need great sound, AND I need low sound latency, I noticed that in bluetooth mode, the latency is just too high. Like ~100 ms high. Maybe this can be improved to like 40 ms with the right bluetooth controller, but I really want ~5 ms.When I first got it, and I tried to use wired mode (and stumbled upon the 2.5mm jack, had to buy new cables. Wtf is wrong with you. >:C), the sound quality was trashed. I don't mean ""bad"" like some picky audiophile. I mean TRASHED. I can hardly describe how bad it is, it's like the volume is dropped by 30 db, and for some reason only a few narrow bands of frequency manage to make it through, making some noises come through orders of magnitude louder than others. It's just this unlistenable murky mess. No exaggerationThis problem persisted for like 3 days, and it all of a sudden went away for no reason. It worked just fine for a whole month, (and I adored the sound quality) and now the problem has come back for no reason. What the hell is this? I noticed that if I back out the jack on my DAC by ~1/16 inch, I get decent sound quality IN MONO. Unacceptable. Factory resetting the headphones did nothing. A firmware update did nothing. Restarting my computer? nothing. Shutting off all bluetooth? Nothing.The other features are fine. Maybe I felt like the bass was comparatively weak to my old bassy cans, but I got used to it.",05/23/2024,AGGGNM37DWTLZE7UPYKWPFJCCBCQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
630,R11QF4OKPIM01C,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wait For The Next Version,J.C.,3,"The ANC was incredible, the battery life was amazing, everyone could hear my voice on calls, they were comfortable, connected over Bluetooth, USB-C, or 3.5mm for audio (with one mini end, which was kind of silly), and they came with a nice case.The construction felt decent enough to me, although, it is definitely not the metal build many come to expect from Sennheiser.Audio quality was a little muddy in my opinion, using it mostly to listen to synthwave music and watching Dolby ATMOS content via PLEX. The app certainly didn't let me dial things in, which may have been why things didn't sound amazing. Overall, it was just okay.So, what's not great? The app on Android is awful, the headphones would sometimes cut out to a loud static, or pick up RF interference, and the touch controls are awful and easily activated by tilting your head. Also, there's no ""Lossless"" option for hi-res audio and you need a separate dongle to use on your PC (and still can't use it as a gaming headset without it stepping down to AM radio quality I/O).Once the new Bluetooth codec standards for lossless 16-bit / 44.1kHz come out, and once you can pair to networks and some of the new protocols coming out in the next few years, I would be curious to see if Sennheiser revises this and fixes the issues I've mentioned.It's very close, but it's just not worth the asking price. Maybe on a sale, or if you're okay with being limited by the codecs available.",06/8/2024,AGX4NRDWLOEZF64P7JCMFL3CU5IQ,1,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
631,ROYKDE0H8KYE6,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite wireless headphones,mariah kemmerer,5,"You can use them while charging - all other arguments are obsolete.Lol but no seriously, not only do these have a crazy long battery life you can also use them while they are plugged in charging. I'm a simple woman with simple needs, but even the Sony M5 can't do that.I had been debating between these and the Sony 1000XM5 and had even purchased the M5. But I had to immediately return them. I'm not sure what it is with Sony and their terrible sizing. They were just too big and loose. Thankfully, Sennheiser has never disappointed and the fit of the Momentum 4 is great. As a general consumer (not a self-proclaimed audiophile) I found these very comparable in build and material to the Sony M5.Coming from always wearing open-back Sennheisers there is a drop in sound quality, but (!) that is expected and I don't find that a detractor. They still sound great. I think the Sony M5 had a bit more of a clearer sound, and the Momentum 4 has a bit too much bass out of the box - but with a little tweaking in the Sennheiser app, I found a happy spot. Noise-canceling is good - I wouldn't say top of its class, but I haven't found myself ever thinking ""gee, I wish they blocked out more noise."" And once I turn on music or a video I don't notice any background noise even in busy places.The mic is okay. I don't really use it, so it's not on my priority list - but if it is for you the Sony M5 outclasses these by a mile on mic quality.The Bluetooth connection works well for me and has a good range. But there can be some drawbacks if you're switching between more than 2 devices regularly. Between my iPad and iPhone, these headphones connect great, and audio will bounce back and forth between them pretty seamlessly. When only 2 devices are connected, they will always be connected and you don't have to do anything to switch between them. BUT once you add a third device you have to start regularly opening the app. You MUST have the app. Because I connected my iPad and phone first, after the headphones get turned on it will auto-connect to those 2 devices (regardless of what it was last connected to). When I first connected these headphones to my computer I couldn't understand why there was no audio and the sound settings were stuck on mute. Fun fact - you have to go into the app and open up the connection manager and toggle on the device you want to use. Only two devices can be toggled on at once. I have to do this every time I want to use these with my computer - because as I said it will revert to my iPad and phone automatically. Not a dealbreaker - but a pain in the ass.Touch controls. I don't hate them. I had a pair of older Bluetooth Sony's with touch controls and absolutely hated them. Bane of my existance. But I find these controls a lot better thought out and executed. I don't accidentally hit them and once I fiddled with the control options in the app (you can customize what some touches do) I really like being able to double-tap between ambient and noise canceling.Overall I really like these headphones and am very happy I returned the Sony M5 and grabbed these.",12/27/2022,AHMZTM2ZRR7O2HALQIPM7OE2UQUA,1,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

634,R24CB2QQ3VORSI,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Not bad but better options for the price,Hayden Compton,3,"I've had these for over 6 months and have been using them near daily since getting them. I don't use full ANC, but the battery lasts for multiple 8-10 hour work days. The headphones are comfortable to wear all day and I don't notice any problems with the clamping pressure or the weight of the headphones sitting on top of my head. The sound quality is great, if you take some time to fine tune the EQ settings. They are also aesthetically pleasing for what it's worth.Most of the problems seem to be software related. Bluetooth switching between phone and laptop is pretty ok but at least once per day my headphones will connect to my phone and I need to shut off the phone bluetooth to get audio from my laptop. Also, there is no ""regular"" mode for the ANC, meaning that you either get the amplified sound outside of the headphones, or can feel the ANC working. There needs to be a setting that turns both off and gives the regular amount of muffling over ear headphones would normally provide. I also despise the fact that I need to use the Sennheiser app on my phone to control EQ or amount of ANC, why not make a simple desktop app that can do the same?",06/6/2024,AFKOEAETUFFKKOLH7WK5CIUZCF4A,1,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
635,RTN9WQR625T86,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars What you need to know...,Randall Whitted,5,"Before buying these, you gotta know some things. First, if you listen to earbuds a lot, over-ear headphones sound different. The sound is less directly in your ear, and more around you. As such, there is less impact. That doesn't mean these aren't good, they're just not shoved into your ear.Second, the source makes or breaks these. A crappy source will sound crappy on these and you'll end up blaming the headphones. It's actually a feature of the headphones though. They reproduce what you put into them very well. Go into Spotify and mess with the EQ there if you feel the need. I like sharp treble and got it that way. Change the stream setting to highest quality. Plug them into a good digital to analog converter (DAC). Try different sources and you'll see whatever you may not be liking is not the headphones. As an acoustic guitarist, I was hoping for the same sound I get with my Martin on my lap. I'd love to have headphones that sound like Tony Rice and Dave Grisman are standing on either side of me, but that's not gonna happen. Again, the source matters. These headphones are not a hand-built American acoustic guitar played by a master standing next to you, but they'll sound more like it than the majority of headphones.Third, we've become programmed to in-your-face sound. These Momentum 4 are very much ""grown-up"" headphones. They articulate. They detail. The present. But they don't floor you with over-the-top sound all through the range. There are plenty of good, inexpensive headphones and earbuds that will pop your eardrums. I personally recommend Anker for that. My Space A40 earbuds are awesome, but when I A/B tested the A40 and these Momentum 4, I realized there were instruments I didn't even realize were there when listening with the A40 earbuds.Fourth, the bluetooth is dumb at first. From what I can tell, they won't work like you'd expect until you launch the app as part of the connection process. It's fine though. Just don't give up on them right off the bat because of that.Other random thoughts - they're super UNcomfortable right away, become very comfortable rather quickly - like within minutes. Also, good headphones do have a break-in period, and these are no exception. Be sure to try the wired connection on some different sources as well. MacBooks have good DACs in them. Anker makes a good USB-C to aux adapter with a DAC in it. The bluetooth connection can sound pretty dang good though. And the microphones in this headset are almost creepy-good. Also, bluetooth range is perfectly fine. I went three rooms away in my house with no issues at all.Summary - I was thinking of returning these, but I know Sennheiser so I messed with settings and connections and I'm glad I did. They're great headphones, but the key is to remember - if your source is crap, they will faithfully reproduce that crap.",12/21/2023,AEJWET4WAUKOAUJKFYEZSZKWTTNA,1,104,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

638,R2GC7X8P84LSAI,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost excellent,Lloyd,4,"After much research I decided on these. I chose them for the positive reviews and the good price pint. I really like the look as well. I purchased them in white. After receiving them I quickly downloaded the app and got stated. As many have said, the app isn’t always great. Sometimes, it doesn’t connect properly and it really annoying. I am not an audiophile or a tech person but these sound great. I use the podcast setting constantly. Music sounds pretty amazing. I also love the intuitive touch controls. I looked at the manual online and watched a ton of videos to make sure I was optimizing the features. They are pretty comfortable. The ear cups actually don’t bother me when I have earrings in or glasses on which is great. The headpiece is very soft and luxurious feeling. The automatic pause and restart is awesome when it works. Then only issue with this is that if I take them off and lay them down and do not turn them off, when you go to play something Bluetooth’d to another device, it’s will often just play on you headphones that are laying down somewhere no not on your head. The ANC is just ok. I bought these because I stupidly knocked my Bose off of my head while cleaning the pool. They still work after much drying but they don’t last long on the charge. These are nowhere near the ANC of the Bose or even AirPod Pros. I have not used the SONYs so I cannot compare those. However, I am fine with them being just ok in this feature as I use them outside to walk and run and kind of would like to be able to hear what’s going on around me without having full traffic noise. Here are my issues…..first off, every phone call that comes in, when I answer it with headphones on….it immediately disconnects the call. It works fine if I call out. I have noticed this is a problem as evidenced on messages boards but there doesn’t really seem to be much of a solution. I contacted the company to see if they. Had a solution. Their response? Just return them to Amazon, as they have a better return policy in the Sennheiser Amazon store. The return policy is 30 days. Mind you….I purchased them March 24, and my original email was sent March 29. Today is April 24. Thus, leaving me no time to return them (I DID tell them in my email when I purchased them). I asked two questions and they didn’t address the one above at all. Really unhappy with the customer service for a $300 product. So, if you’re a tech and figure out whatever issue you have; great. their wise maybe look somewhere that has better customer service. But, they DO sound great and are comfortable.",04/24/2023,AGHSFBOT6TPDTGZFUMTIZP577SOQ,1,24,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I had a few Sennheiser headsets over the years, and this one is major disappointment. I bought it because PXC550 was aging and I always wanted to buy momentum, because it was considered higher product line.1. Design - it is step back from original Momentum. If I wanted Sony I could buy Sony. I bought this headset because I like the brand, but design...why not copy iPods? Dumb.2. Comfort- clamping action is much stronger then PXC550 or Sony XM5(tried in store). Pads relatively hard and ears sometimes do not fit well.3. Controls - BAD, really BAD, DID I mention that they are BAD? I am comparing them to old model of PXC550.On/OFF functionality - why not to keep same function when cups are flat headset is off when turned in listening position headset is ON. With this headset you never know if the are on or off. Reviewers say ""it is not a problem because headset has large battery life"" - this is most dumb excuse you can come up with.Tap to Play/Pause - some times it works some times it does does not. You never know what will happen, will play, will it stop, will it turn off ANC?Volume Up/Down- no audible feed back when you raising or lowering the volume using headset and no immediate reaction. Why not to keep same functionality as on older headsets each volume change would respond with the sound.ANC- What ANC? most reviewers say it is slightly worse then Sony ... they are lying it is pretty much worse then anything I had, including $30 Chinese junk. This gesture adjustment does not really work, double tap sometimes work some times does not. On maximum ANC I still hear voices and passing cars. However it does cancel the wind which is good.4. Sound - Ok sound is not really bad. It is well balanced and has just a few more details then other headsets I tried Not within same price range, but within same consumer class I could hear background singer on one of the songs. It is louder then PXC550 which is good, but balance and detail is pretty much the same. This headset has no Stage at all. Sound lucking ""WOW"" feeling, it is pretty flat.I noticed this headsets has random disconnects. not really bad, but still worth to mention.I am still thinking about returning it, or keep it for few more days to see if they grow on me.I would say price (250) is pretty good for what you get.if you never had anything better it would be good headset for the money.",01/12/2024,AGFPE3TGGCHH7S4DE5Z7HZ7ZCAUA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
640,R3BCMJ8RYR5L76,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Was I just maybe expecting too much?,Giratina,3,"Based on other reviews I decided to pick these up and the btd600 dongle meant to go with it for pc etc, Honestly im pretty disappointed. First the anc may as well not exist as it blocks nothing even when set to max or adaptive, can still hear everything as if its right next to me. Second the sound quality sounds... not sure how to describe it but maybe muddy or sounding like you're listening through a barrier. The headphones also struggle to handle intense songs like edm without distorting any voices while there is any bass and almost vibrates the voice causing it to sound off (ive tested tons of eq settings). Using them wired doesn't seem to fix the quality issue either. The bass itself is fine though once adjusted depending on the song speed. The touch controls turn back on every time you turn these off even when set to off on every device you have it connected to. Comfort wise they do start to bend and hurt your ears after a while requiring constant adjusting. Overall I'm pretty disappointed for something in the $300+ range as they sound like other $100 headphones.

641,R1OLFI88OUFMZ9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Best in class!,Shelby Yale Marr,5,"I went to BestBuy to get my hands on a few of the top contenders. Sony XM5, Bose 700, and a few others not worth mentioning. They did not have a Sennheiser momentum 4 in the store for demo, they had to be ordered. The battery life of the Sony and the Bose were better than the others they had available in store. The sound quality was good. The materials felt cheap some more than others. I did not care for the skinny headband on some of them. After trying them out, I went on Amazon’s website and ordered the Sennheiser momentum 4. The 60 hour battery life, and fast charging is amazing. The noise canceling is excellent, I work with a lot of heavy equipment, it is loud all the time. I have used them on several long flights for both music from my phone or my tablet, or the airplanes movie selection. Several of the flights had very loud and obnoxious children, the noise canceling and good volume level made it much more pleasant. The build quality of the Sennheiser momentum 4 feels much more premium than the Sony or the Bose. The sound quality and clarity is unmatched to anything that I have tried, as far as wireless headphones. The frequency response is incredible with the 42 mm drivers. The gesture controls are intuitive, and very easy to use and get used to. I can wear them for hours my head does not get tired or sore. Everyone that I have come across that has tried them wants to set for themselves. Using them at work I often have multiple phone calls, there are gestures you can use on the side control to swap between calls. The microphones built into the headset pick up your voice clearly and eliminate background noise and wind for very clear calls. They are great for short sessions, but also long sessions as I have worn them for over 12 hours in a row. I wear glasses and they do not bother me while wearing glasses. I have had them for nearly a year. The battery life is still very strong. You can go on vacation and not have to charge the headphones until you return. I had a pair of Brookstone noise, canceling headphones years ago. When they eventually failed, I picked up a pair of Sony noise, canceling headphones. The Sony’s eventually failed as well. I replaced them with Bose they were wired the wire deteriorated very rapidly. Replaced them with a set of Bose earbuds, they are handy, but for a long flight the Sennheiser’s are definitely the way to go. Amazing sound quality. Transparency mode is also a very handy feature. Double tap the side of the headphone to activate or deactivate transparency mode so you can hear what is going on around you. The ability to lift the ear cup to pause playback is very handy. They also power down when you place them in the very nice case.",07/12/2023,AGXNT7BE4PKZY7LPRQ5IMFXHPLTQ,1,19,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
642,R2UYH59HBOTDSC,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent pair of headphones,Tyler,4,"I already had plans to buy these but after my Sennheiser CX wireless earbuds took a tumble in the washer, I kinda had to get these. I was already aware of the numerous issues that people had with these headphones but after having these for 2 weeks, I never ran into any of them.First Impression- Overall really like the look of these with the fabric headband and an all-around clean look. A little plasticky feeling but it isn't the kind of cheap plastic you would find on inexpensive headphones.Sound Quality- Now I'm not a big headphone person or audiophile guy but to me, these sound great and are probably one of the best-sounding over-ear wireless headphones I've ever owned. Super clear sound and very good bass.Call Quality- Mic is what you’d expect. Not the best but it's good enough for calls. I was able to hear clearly from people on the other end and they heard me on the other end perfectly fine. Side-Tone works great too however I don't like hearing myself so I keep it off.ANC-It really isn't that bad, although it doesn't match the quality that Sony headphones have, it's enough to water out most sounds around you however lower frequencies tend to pass through.App and Controls-The app is super easy to navigate through with a lot of settings to choose from. One of these settings would be an equalizer so you can mess around and find your own preferred sound configuration. Touch controls definitely took some time to get used to but they are very reactive to touch and I don't think you’ll need to do any double tapping. You can also disable touch controls if you don't like them. To address pairing issues, I had absolutely none. Might be different for you since I do still see these complaints every now and then.Comfort-Comfort is something that comes down to preference and to me, these were very comfortable on my head. I have a very large head so I had to adjust these to the max and they fit super well. Ear cups are nice and soft and the padding on the headband is firm on the sides and super squishy on the top. Overall super comfy on my head and I’ve yet to run into any issues with discomfort.Battery Life-Battery life is also pretty great too. 60 hours of battery life is more than plenty and can last you a whole week depending on how often you use them.Overall I think these are great all-around headphones that are great for daily use and travel. Of course, these do have some issues but they don't bother me enough to not recommend these headphones.",05/24/2023,AEQT6ADH6CI7LIAZKS2DH2DKTMFA,1,36,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

They don’t really “feel” like 277 headphones but they’re very comfortable. Battery life is super long.,07/4/2024,AHIBQUZW573RJELGMA4RTXZKSWDA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
644,R2QVBA1G7PUXO9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Love 'em,David,5,"Comfortable. Intuitive touch controls. Battery life. Design.Prior to purchase I did lots of research (thank you early adopters that do video reviews and websites that do qualitative reviews). I purchased these over other similarly priced brands based on the available features, price and design style. I have no remorse for the price I have paid.A little more depth:First, sound was a big priority for me -- I wanted a pair of headphones that reproduced sound/music as closely as an original artist may have desired. I found a website, soundguys.com, that provided a frequency-response (an audio-sweep starting from the 10's of Hz to the 10's of kHz is played through the headphones then the output noise difference is measured) graph for the headphones showing a very good sound reproduction (compared to a similarly priced set of Sony headphones these were more true to the input audio sweep).Second was design. I am a big fan of having the cups of the headphones attached to the headband via the swiveling 'pitch fork' design. Mounted/affixed to the middle of the/a headphone-cups. From an engineering/physics perspective, this means the pushing/pressing force exerted by the headband through the cups is centered from the middle of the cups, as opposed to the tops of the cup's--which invariably results in the pushing pressure being more towards the top of the cups (assumptions based on the XM5's design).Third. Comfort. The somewhat flat headband with its padding is forgettable and the pressure it supplies to the cups to the sides of one's (average size) head is sufficient -- maybe a little on the lite side. Also, the inside (head side) of the headband is a rubbery-like material, so no fears of hair/scalp oils dirtying a fabric there.Lastly, a subjective review of the sound, ANC, and call quality. I think the sound is amazing! The ANC is super cool. I've worn these on public transit (daily on the bus, and weekly on the train) and finally feel like I won't have any hearing damage from having to listen to the drone of the engine or cabin noise. You will still have some awareness of sounds around you, especially those of higher pitch/tone, but if you have music going (half volume for me) you will not hear any thing. Pass-through mode is also quite nice, though sometimes other's voices may sound quite (again, due to using half volume).Call quality is great. I held a phone call wherein I had a fan blowing on my head (wind noise). Neither I or my caller could hear any of the noise from the fan.Since owning the headphones, Sennheiser has released a firmware update for the ANC. Before and after the update I cannot empirically say I've notice any difference. Knowing Sennheiser will push updates to further improve the product is also reassuring (though for this price point, I believe most companies are doing this).Several sites/videos say that a similarly priced set of Sony's has better ANC than these, but I'll argue that you don't need a pair of Sony's to enjoy/receive a similar experience!Very subjective final thought: These (in white) look better than the competition.",09/9/2022,AFESKG7TMN4LQ6DRVCIB355WIX5Q,1,15,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
645,RJOEYU7BI5AO4,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars While these sound fantastic, unfortunately the bad overpowers the good",ThereAreOrangesEverywhere,3,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser headphones for years and I have several other wired headphones from them that I've used for years as well. After reading up on the current wireless headphone offerings from various companies I decided to buy these since I already trusted the brand and the reviews were shining.I'm an audiophile hobbyist with a large head that makes most headphones become uncomfortable after a short amount of time being worn. I also have small ears and most in-ear headphones either don't fit at all or slip out within the first 10 minutes. I have some Airpod Pros that I sometimes use, but these also slip out from my ears constantly. The Sennheiser Momentum 4's fit better than a lot of headphones I've had, however after about 30 minutes of use, they become uncomfortable for me. If they just extended out a little further I don't think that would be an issue, but they don't. I wish more headphone companies made their headphones with greater expandable options, but oh well. If you're reading this and also had the large-head problem, I have a pair of AKG K 702as that I've used for a decade and they're very comfortable.The comfort is not the main issue though. It's the software to manage the headphones, and also the software/firmware on the headphones themselves. It has trouble connecting to the headphones consistently. The headphones also would frequently (and randomly) disconnect while listening to music on my iPhone. It was incredibly frustrating, and after reading through some forums I found that it was due to more than one device being in the headphones ""Devices"" list (my wife tried these on her phone at one point). Even though the other device was not actively trying to connect and even had Bluetooth completely off, the issue was happening a lot. Once I removed the 2nd device through the app, the connectivity issues went away.That is not my main complaint with the headphones though. The ANC cannot be turned off. You can adjust it to your hearts content from full blast ANC to full transparency, but ANC is on at all times. That's not necessarily a deal breaker, but for some reason the ANC on these cans gave me instant headaches. I tried researching why this could be happening and how to reduce this, and since these headphones have some adaptive ANC capabilities I tried listening outside, in an empty room, in a car, downtown, etc. - and it always gave me a headache.If the app let you disable ANC entirely I would have gladly kept them. The sound is fantastic, especially for the price. The bass is very rich, the mids are clean and the highs are crisp without being shrill. The soundstage is extremely impressive given these are closed back. I would have thought these cost at least twice what they do on the sound alone. The battery is also super impressive, these lasted almost two weeks of daily use before I had to charge them.Sennheiser is a sound company, not a software company. If they are going to force managing features of their headphone into an app, they really need to build out the app better and have options as simple as turning on/off ANC. While I'm all for new technology and software (I work as a software engineer), I'm more old-school with devices like this specifically for this reason. If these cans had a few actual buttons or switches to toggle ANC and some other basic features instead of relying on an app and swipe gestures, I'd keep them forever.",01/25/2023,AEVMPVH3K5FBJXFMQMM6YAPNDNUA,1,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
646,RONNQB3KB0IWS,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones and extraordinary battery but iOS app did not work.,PMJ,4,"I received these headphones and put them on my head and they immediately paired with my iPhone (14 Pro Max). Touch controls are a little tricky but they do work. Sound is warm, balanced and very pleasant. I have a large head and the headphones feel comfortable covering my ears correctly. They seem to be light and well balanced. Sound is well balanced without being bass heavy or 'lumpy' with excellent detail on all the types of music to which I listen (mainly jazz, classical, electronic jazz and fusion with classic pop thrown in). I have yet to compare with the direct wired connect or via USB. Probably the best noise reduction headphones I have heard and are much smoother than the Sony XM4 and XM5 and less processed than the Bose QC 45s.The iOS app did not work. I installed it after the headphones had paired with my iPhone (as instructed by the instructions), started the app which showed that they had connected but when I tapped the headphone icon, it said it had not connected and I had to power off and remove the headphones from the bluetooth list on my phone. I performed the necessary changes and tried again with no success. I tried this 5 or 6 times with the same results. I gave up and tried a number of other strategies. I reset the headphones, deleted and reinstalled the app all to no avail.The headphones sound great but the inconvenience of trying to configure them manually is less helpful so I decided to send them back.Update 1: I also have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) and tried the installation of the app on that phone. BT pairing was more problematic but once paired the app worked correctly. I reset the headphones using the app (deleting the BT pairing list) and updated the headphones firmware. After doing this I tried again on the iPhone and it worked correctly this time. I am not sure whether it was the complete reset to factory settings or the updated firmware but it now appears to work on both iOS and Android.",08/26/2023,AGTBK447OV5VAYFLVLFCMC3NOCDA,1,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
647,RW0GW7VS1ML79,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Punching WAY above their price point but have several unfortunate annoying features,Jordan Sage,4,"I have recently trued out a number of headphones across a variety of price points (e.g., the HifiMan Arya Stealth, B&W PX7, B&O H95). These beat out all the headphones that cost more than double. They were the most engaging of the wireless 'phones to listen to and the ones I wanted to keep coming back to. The are fun and energetic sounding, and are pretty generous in sound quality across the timbres. There is nothing these do that stands out sound-wise as super great - but no great sins anywhere either, and I did not find another bluetooth headphone that had such a good, balanced whole-picture sound like these do.I did, however, almost return these.The bluetooth interrupted several important business calls with no prompting from me whatsoever (and again, I had a half dozen Bluetooth headphones by my phone and none of them automatically interrupted more than 10-15 minutes into a call - totally unprompted - like these did).The other issue is that Sennhieser tried, I suppose, to get fancy with the touch controls on the side of the Right can. The issue with this is, if you touch or rest them against anything, the buttons will go off haphazardly. No other headphone I tested had any such issue. If you even lift these to scratch your ear, they will shut off or do something unintended. The good thing though is when you are ready to listen, you put them on your head and they will synch near instantaneously and be ready to play music. That's cool. But I am learning to live with all the unwanted features and touch activation of these.Altogether, I don't believe anything will touch these at the price point, and you would be hard-pressed to find many options under $1,000 that don't require an amplifier that will either. The feature set is annoying and intrusive. The design is bland and cheap looking. But they are comfortable to wear and they sound great. I guess that is just enough.",09/26/2023,AGUUYWB4JEORCZRCDA47JC4J2OQA,1,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

649,R1ZBIQTOJ15PHY,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars But are they, are they really?",Lost_And_Confused,3,"I am really hesitant to write a review in light of how many people have left reviews that sound like they would give their first born for these things. I am not in that camp. I have several sets of over-the-ear and in-ear headsets including the Apple Airpod Max and the new Sony MX5. Having used equipment from Senn for 30 years, I am familiar with their products and how their philosophy, so many others, has changed over that time with a leaning towards mass market. Oh, I get it...make money or close the doors. All that said, here is my real world experience. Upon opening them, I like the case, the wired adapter, etc. The headset is lightweight and very comfortable, even when wearing with glasses. That said, they are the ""cheapest looking/feeling"" headset from Senn I have ever seen...they really feel like cheap plastic crap...but that is not why you buy a headset. Just setting expectations here. The battery life claim of 60 hours is absolutely comical - I have been getting more around 12 hours (calls/music/online meetings - almost all with ANC). The ANC itself is not at the level of Apple or Sony. It works, and I have been on a couple flights with them. There does not seem to be any background noise filtering on the microphone side though - certainly not on par with Apple or Sony, though the ANC works well enough for the wearer. Max volume is lower than other brands, if that is important to you, but certainly loud enough. Bass response is significantly BETTER than Apple or Sony, though the sound quality as a whole is muddier with less staging than others. The pairing has been fairly smooth - no where as seamless as say the Airpod Max's if you are in an Apple ecosystem, but on par with most other brands. The app is a bit pointless, but given that the single button and touch controls arent the greatest, it is helpful. For example, the pinching/reverse-pinching to engage ANC sort of works...? I did have my first pair of these die after about 10 hours of use - would no longer pair and the lights just did a non stop light show - but got them replaced through Amazon without issue, as I had them only 2 days. Conclusions? Given that the Apple product is always on sale for $100 off, the price point between all three products (The Sony MX5's, the Airpod Max's and these) are within $100 of each other, I would have a hard time recommending these to friends or family. I really cannot find a single compelling reason to select these over competing products. I mean, they are bad by any means, just bland. They don't stand out from a looks, sound, ANC, build quality, functionality, or any other way...they work, well enough, and in the class they are in they are fairly priced. I honestly feel you could do better with the Apple Airpod Max if you are a big Apple user or the Sony MX5's otherwise - and be happier with either of those versus these. In fact, if plastic, lower quality builds, but with good sound, good bass response and decent ANC is your thing, you could do better with the over the ear model from Status Audio and save a couple hundred bucks. Of course, all of the above is my personal opinion, not paid, no free samples, no fancy audio test equipment...YMMV.",09/13/2022,AFYGCCFUGZL6PNRESNIUYWDTPMJQ,1,30,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

653,R3T563LHCTJ4N1,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Love the headphones except for the garbled noise at times!!!!,azsteve01,4,"Sennheiser headphones have been my main headphones for watching TV since 2016 when i purchased the RS-175 wireless headphones. Roku has created a Private Listening mode and you cannot switch from headphone to tv/soundbar speakers easily since Roku disabled the TOSLink/headphone jack when you are using the Dolby sound hardware. A solution was needed and since you can connect to the soundbar via bluetooth the decision was made to find a bluetooth headphone that met my standards. Because of my loyalty to Sennheiser headphones the Momentum 4 were chosen.As stated Roku has created a Private Listening feature that makes it hard to use wire/fibre connection and bluetooth is the best solution to resolve the issues making it easier to switch between speakers and headphones.Major Issue:The only main issue with the Momentum 4 headphones is when you first connect, the sound is garbled for 5 to 10 seconds. You can either wait for the sound to clear up (annoying) or restart the video which can be a pain. Youtube and Plex are my main video apps i use and with youtube having to restart the videos each time gets old fast. The garbled sound is the same no matter what firmware is used.Minor issues:When you have the Momentum 4 connected to the app (iPhone) every time you are disconnected from the TV/Soundbar you have to use the app to reconnect. This is not convenient if the phone is not near. Unfortunately Roku has decided to disconnect any bluetooth connected after 5 minutes of idle time to save battery power on the headphones. This is not a Momentum 4 issue but reconnecting with the app make this cumbersome. Because of this problem the app is not being used at all and the headphones are set to factory default.The fit is not as good as the RS-175, ear cups need to be bigger.Pros:Excellent Sound, Long Battery Life, Noise Cancelling (even cancels out conversations), Touch Features, Light WeightI would recommend these to others but only if Sennheiser fixes the garbled issue.",08/18/2023,AHVWXOJUZYGFL7XQW5OY73KHERGQ,1,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

655,R30434Q2LI61Q,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars great sound, cancellation and battery but . . .",mike,5,"I decided on these because of the reviews. And price was right for me.Here is my honest opinion. Sound is awesome, and noise cancelling is good. The special features (like headphone turn off and on as you take them off and on. Side ear swipe controls and sennheiser app for more controls) Well . . . if they work . . . it is very nice. You can only run the app through your phone. So that is a drawback. I found the swipe controls don't hardly work unless you are using the app itself. So if I have music say on amazon music unlimited through my laptop none of the feature work well, or at all. If I am running my music through my phone and with the app the features work at first but the the longer I listen the less likely they are bound to work. Meaning the swipe controls for vol, skip song and tap on and off and turning on noise cancellations setting. I lose connection more then I should for no reason.Lets just say I have to go back to my phone app to turn on and off the feature to get them to work correctly way too much. So If you are OK with great sound and noise cancellation with a super long battery life and can put up with the flaws of the special features that you paid for, then buy these. They are very comfortable for me. Sound was too good to send them back though, just disappointed in the special features that sometimes work and sometimes not. (haven't used phone feature at all yet)update 06-16-24: So I now have had these about a year now. My opinion has changed and I thought I would update my review. I am old (62) so I still do a lot of listening through my MP3 players (I have several - not always listening through my phone). My biggest gripe when I got them was the controls and getting the touch features to work properly. Well, it may have been operator error and just getting used to the headphones. I don't seem to be having any trouble with any listening device anymore. When I take my headphones off my head they stop and when I put them back on they start. One thing that I had trouble with early on. I have had a chance to try out the phone features and sound since the purchase and it is pretty darn good. I can not compare to other competitors though, And I don't use that a lot.So sound is great, comfort is great, battery is great and features are now upgraded to great as wellI love em.

656,R1QTST5YMU94UV,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, but uncomfortable, with serious firmware issues",Brandon Watkins,4,"I'm borderline obsessed with Sennheiser, and gave these headphones an honest try; I really wanted to like them, but until they fix the firmware, I couldn't recommend these to anyone. Tested on multiple devices, all of which are up to date.To future-proof my review (because I won't remember to edit my review once the firmware problems have been addressed), I rated these 4 stars based on the assumption that there will be a future fix to the firmware problems. If taking the firmware into account, I think I'd rate these 2 stars (as of 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphones have quality sound, probably on par with the price point. Not significantly better than my PXC 550-II's, but they do have a bit more depth and bass.Their noise cancellation is good, but not as good as my Bose QC35’s, which is to be expected.The battery life is incredible. I don't think I'm getting 60 hours (volume kept at around 20-40%), but they're still awesome.Cons:These are nowhere near as comfortable as my Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. They put more pressure on my ears/temples, and the headband is way firmer. My head is aching after about 30 minutes of use.There are significant firmware issues (my firmware is up to date, as of 8/31/22):When using the auto power off mode, they turn on (and sync to your phone) any time they’re moved. This will of course silence your phone’s alerts, as they’re playing over the headphones that you didn’t mean to turn on.When using the on-head detection, they keep turning on and off while they're sitting around my neck.Whenever I answer my phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) and change the output to these headphones it just hangs up the phone. Haven't tried answering using the headphone's touch controls, it's possible that would work.While the transparency mode is a nice feature, it's almost laughable compared to my AirPod Pro's and Sony WF-1000XM4's. It sounds just barely better than wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These can connect to 2 devices at a time, but when switching between paired (and connected) devices (for example: listening to audio on my tablet, when I get a text alert on my phone, which interrupts tablet audio for a second, before switching back to tablet again), and whenever I answer my phone, as mentioned above, audio quits playing over my headphones. My phone says it's still connected, but it doesn't show up as an output in any apps. I have to reconnect it to my phone to get it working again.Whenever I pair them with a new device, it disconnects from existing connected devices. I have to reconnect afterward.As much as I want to like these headphones, until Sennheiser fixes these software issues, it's just not worth the hassle.",08/31/2022,AENHFSUN5AOQRWBL5HVKOFBRSN4A,1,56,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
657,R9UOJPHMC1N5R,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones with a few nitpicks,Stan Jarensky,5,"I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.",08/27/2022,AFWSMMKN2GVUKOJA4BDMDRSG7JZQ,1,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I have used them for calls but not often and they are pretty good to me. noise cancelling is pretty good although I only use them at home and for listening to music.. i may put them on the charger after 2-3 weeks.. they are comfortable to me although i don't really wear them for too long.. maybe 30 min to an hour at a time.. great purchase for me..",02/16/2024,AEGBBKERC3JXLZEPK7HIYYUF4IWA,1,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
659,RJB49JIZ1OE9H,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but not great due to finicky features.",Ryan M Robinson,4,"The sound, noise cancellation, durability, and battery life were the reasons I bought these headphones, and they've delivered in those areas. Sadly, I'm knocking a star off the overall rating because of their ""quality"" of life features and short range.The headphones are meant to sense when they're on your head or not. Sadly, these think they're on my head when they're not, and not on my head when they are, with annoying frequency.Occasionally the ""buttons"" stop working. I use quotes because the actual button works fine, but the tap controls seem to stop working randomly. They'll do the little noise in my ear that indicates the headphones have registered me tapping, but have no actual effect.Further, I live in a house of about 950 sq. ft., yet if I leave the 8x8 room that is my office there's a good chance the sound will start cutting in and out due to the poor range of these headphones. I had a pair of $60 headphones before these, and the range was twice as good on those. This results in sound skipping in and out if I'm more than 6 feet away from my computer, or about 8 feet with no walls in between. It would be nice to be able to fold laundry in the next room over while listening to these, but I cannot.Overall, great sound quality, durability, noise cancelling (very important as I'm work from home with a toddler and an infant in the house), and battery life (I use them 8-10hrs per day and charge once per week), but poor quality of life. For the price, I expected headphones that work correctly.",09/28/2023,AESDI6RME6JBOBVQLOLCSJKOA7GQ,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

662,R3QDH5SFCC0EE9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 vs Sony WH-1000XM5,Matthew,5,"I've been a Sennheiser fan for a while now and wanted to give these a shot vs the fan favored Sony WH-1000XM5s. Used the Momentum 4s for around a week and was incredibly impressed with the battery life, ease of use, and the sound quality. If you have some audiophile grade equipment with a separate DAC/Amp combo this does not sound as good. That being said, this is miles above alternatives in it's price range.After adjusting to the sound of the Sennheisers for a few days, I immediately had a negative reaction when trying out the Sonys. To my ears they had a noticably dryer sound profile where the highs and mids sounded muffled and flat in comparison (Note: not accuracy flat, just plain dull sounding). The bass is pretty equivalent, at least in EDM/metal/hip hop genres. I listened for a few hours in the Sonys and just couldn't find any songs I thought sounded measurably better than the Sennheisers. Even listening to the same song on the tablet and phone with both headphones back to back, everything was brighter, clearer, and warmer in the Sennheisers and have a noticably better build quality. My first initial reaction to Sennheiser build quality was negative because they felt much lighter than I was expecting having used more serious headphones. The Sonys felt even lighter and more plastic-y/cheaper in comparison.The noise cancelling was noticably better in the Sonys than the Sennheisers, which may or may not be a deal breaker for some. I would imagine the Sonys would perform better on an airplane, but for home/office use I was perfectly happy with both.TLDR: The Sennheisers are the no brainer choice for me.**Momentum 4 quirks/nit picking:- My head gets hot in any headphones with leather ear cups, I could not find alternative/cooler padding which is worth the sound/seal trade off.- The sensors to know if it's on your head are pretty sensitive. It's good when you lift off an ear to hear someone else in the room, they pause. It's bad when you take them off, they 'sleep' on the desk, anything brushes/touches the headphones. It will automatically switch your audio source from your phone back to the headphones. Depending on how often you listen to audio on your phones speaker or are around where these will be when you are not using them, it's easier to turn them off when not in use to avoid having to change your media output on your phone back to the speaker. Samsung phones have a quick media output switch in the drop down quick menu, but not all phones make it this easy.",08/15/2023,AGJ3EARFU6PJA75WKR76Z7WUOLNA,1,27,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
663,R3S9UDPCJTRMN0,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars M4’s vs XM5’s, if you’re after sound quality this is it.",Seth Montgomery,5,"Sound Quality:So first of all, I have been a big fan of Sony’s wireless lineup and decided to take a departure with these. After these arrived, I did a direct comparison on these vs Sony’s XM5’s, with EQ to my liking and without (across several genres.) The M4’s even without any EQ adjustments beat my XM5’s with them. Man, these things sound great. Clear, precise, open sound. The treble is truly so much more detailed than on the XM5’s, and the midrange and bass feel balanced in more naturally. When I switched back to XM5’s to compare, I was actually shocked at just how much I felt like I was missing in comparison.Comfort:The XM5’s spoil you a bit with their insane plush earcups and super light weight, but I was expecting a bigger difference between those and the M4’s. For me, these are perfectly comfortable. XM5’s definitely win here, but the SQ on the M4’s more than makes up for that.Noise Cancelling:I’m not the person to give the best feedback on this, it’s the last thing I care about. However, If noise cancelling happens to be your main consideration, it’s XM5 here.Setup/connectivity:I was prepared for problems and inconveniences based on reviews and got none. Smooth experience for me so far.In summary, GREAT sound, and if that’s your biggest consideration, I don’t know if you’ll find better elsewhere in Bluetooth headphones anywhere close to this price point. All of the other issues I’ve read about on here before buying were non-issues for me.

666,RQ0W5FUGCFR5X,B0B6GHW1SX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, bad UX Design.",Cacho K,2,"The PXC-550 headphones were my go-to for the past three years, striking the perfect balance between quality sound and comfort, with just a couple of drawbacks: a lack of USB-C support and less-than-ideal battery life. Eager for an upgrade, I transitioned to their successor MOMENTUM, hoping for improvements. On paper, the new model seemed to promise just that—a better, more refined listening experience. However, while the upgrade delivered in some areas, it faltered in others, revealing design flaws that the PXC-550 had already mastered.On the plus side, the sound quality is exceptional, with noise cancellation that effectively silences the outside world, and a battery life that feels almost endless. These improvements alone make the headphones a significant leap forward.But not all changes are for the better. The new design is bulkier. More frustratingly, the intuitive fold-to-turn-off (and on) feature of the PXC-550 has been omitted. The satisfying click of the folding switch, which once brought a sudden moment of reassurance—a Deus ex Machina moment between you and this piece of machinery—is gone. Now, turning off the headphones requires holding down a button for an awkwardly long pause, a process that can accidentally trigger pairing mode instead of powering down. This seemingly small change significantly impacts the user experience, transforming seamless transitions into moments of annoyance.Imagine this: You're about to start your car journey, only to discover your headphones have remained on, constantly attempting to connect to your phone, disrupting the peace of your drive. Or picture yourself at your desk, a sudden visitor arrives, and you're caught in an awkward dance of trying to turn off your headphones, a delay that interrupts the flow of life.This shift from the elegantly simple act of folding your headphones to turn them off and on to a cumbersome, button-dependent process adds up, not just in seconds wasted but in the sheer inconvenience it represents, especially when you know how effortless it once was. The PXC-550 made life smoother, akin to having a trusted steed by your side in the relentless battle of daily existence—a companion so reliable, its absence is profoundly felt.In light of these experiences, one can't help but yearn for a simple solution: a PXC-550 reimagined with USB-C. Such a proposition seems a minor ask for the return of what was lost—the instant gratification and reassurance of effortlessly powering down by folding, a feature that made the PXC-550 an indispensable part of life's arsenal.One could say that the new headphones, while technologically superior, miss the mark on understanding the rhythm of life. The joy of technology is not just in its capability but in its ability to blend seamlessly into our lives, enhancing without complicating. The previous model understood this, becoming more than just a tool for listening—it was a companion in the epic battle of everyday life.As it stands, despite its technological strides, the newer model leaves something to be desired for those of us who cherish both the journey and the simplicity of interaction with our gadgets. In essence, the quest for improvement should not forsake the intuitive pleasures of the past.Btw 80 seconds a day with this button nonsense, equals to 8 hours a years of frustration.",03/8/2024,AF3JMHEBBABMCAMCXQHQBEXC2ONQ,1,2,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
667,R1HEPV34OXKJS3,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Vastly superior to Sony in a couple of ways...,Amazon Customer,5,"While I used them regularly, I took very good care of my Sony wh-xb910n headphones, and yet they still fell apart within a year. I know it's slightly unfair to compare the Momentum 4 to this particularly Sony headphone but I didn't expect the Sony's to compare in terms of sound quality (they don't come close) or noise cancelling (the Sony's were pretty similar honestly... very good on both). But I did expect quality design and construction since it's virtually identical to higher priced Sony's. Bottom line: Sennheiser has quality construction and Sony doesn't. As soon as you pick up a pair of the Sony's, it's easy to tell that they are somewhat fragile. I even had a pretty good notion of where they would break... and I was right. The Sennheiser's are much more robust, and really feel like they can handle some tough use.I also found the app to be very intuitive and easy to use, unlike a few other reviewers... definitely easier than the Sony app.My only slight complaint is the touch sensitive control feature.

672,R2LOLFHZ6R8BHD,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great and usage is very streamlined,Henry,5,"I like how most Sennheiser headphones sound, and these are no exception. The app also lets you further tune the sound to your liking if you feel the need to, and if you don't want to play around with the EQ options, you can just use the ""sound personalization"" feature which is basically a quiz that will help create an optimal sound setting for you. The usage experience with these is the most streamlined I have had with any headphones so far. I use my headphones primarily with my PC, and with older headphones switching the connection from my PC to my phone was a pain, and because of that I rarely did it. With these, you have multi-point connection, which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once, and the headphones will switch between them based on which one is playing audio. That, combined with the auto on and off feature, means I can just pick these up off my desk and put them on, then use my PC and/or phone as needed without thinking about it, and then just plop them back on my desk when I'm done and they will shut down automatically. There are however a couple of things I can think of to complain about. Number one is I wish Sennheiser made a dedicated Windows app to change settings directly from a PC, but the multi-point connection means this isn't really a big deal anymore because they are always connected to my phone anyway if I want to change settings. Number 2, I would like to have some kind of audio queue when I reach the midpoint between transparency mode and ANC. As is, when you are using the touch controls to scroll between full ANC and full transparency mode, you get an audio queue when you reach either of those settings, but the midpoint where you have neither ANC nor transparency mode active isn't obvious unless you pull out the app and check where it is set. A small issue but it would further improve ease of use with these. Overall, I'm super happy with them.

673,R38G7OCLWMFC4E,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Best sounding BT headphine for the price,AdventureInUtah,4,"I went through a long process of trying to decide on a BT headphone. My usage is primarily on flights and at the gym. I wanted to improve on the sound quality that I was getting from my AirPods Pro 2. For me it was between these, the Bose and Sony. If you listen to all three headphones in noise canceling mode with nothing playing, there is an advantage to the Bose and Sony. They absolutely have better noise canceling, but when listening to music or a movie it is much less noticeable. I let my decision be based on which one sounded better and the Sennheiser was the clear winner. They don't sound as good as my open back, wired Sennheiser headphones but they sound really great for a closed back, Bluetooth headphone.Pros:Amazing Sound QualityVery good noise cancelingRidiculous battery lifeAttractive designComfortable to wear for extended periods of timeSennheiser app makes sound extremely customizabledecent bassCons (to me):I would like them to be a little tighter for the gym.I wish they were a little louder.

674,R2L5D070KJ5IMJ,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars The firmware is not up to par,Lumiere,3,"Pros- Comfortable to wear- Long battery life- Neutral sound- Transparency mode- Works wiredCons- Software is horrible- Firmware is horrible- Transparency mode amplifies wind noises more than voiceMost of my headphones are open back, so I wanted a pair of closed headphones for the office. Since I usually use Sennheiser headphones, that and the transparency mode swayed me to get this over Bose QC45 and Sony 1000XM4.I'm not sure I made the right choice. Almost none of the features work properly.Mine keeps turning off or disconnecting. Listen to 1-3 songs and it'll cut off in the middle of a song. Several times an hour sometimes. Tried it where I don't really have much interference, and same exact thing. Tried wearing it one night to listen to music while sleeping, and it just turned off randomly after about 20 minutes of playing. So it paused my music.Take them off and sometimes they'll still keep playing music. Sometimes, I bump into it laying flat on my desk and it'll start playing music. Tap the right side it clear a click, and music will keep playing. Swipe 2-3 times to change songs and it might do it on the first try or never. Neither my car nor my bluetooth speakers have this type of issues. Then sometimes, you adjust them because they feel like they're falling a bit, and you'll trigger the pause.The battery life is pretty good, thankfully. Because it'll stay on sometimes for hours and not turn off. This is with the 15 minutes auto shut down. So you might come back the next morning and it dropped from 90% to 70% because it never turned off.The transparency mode is... just ok. It makes the AC in my office much louder than when I have my headphones off. Like twice as loud. Unless I turn on max wind ANC. But then sound always sound muffled. But even at max transparency and low music volume, I cannot comprehend anyone talking. It sounds like it amplifies constant noise much more than occasional noise.If I wear them while washing dishes, the ANC works really well here too. So it seems to work best with constant noise.The Android App is also extremely slow. You open it, and it has to connect. After it connects, it's unresponsive for another 5 seconds or so. So it takes 10-15 seconds to open settings.I was expecting a quick button to toggle between listening to music, and transparency mode. Right now, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to adjust. Imagine telling someone to wait 20 seconds while you enable the feature, instead of spending 0.5 second removing them.Additional notes: I didn't buy them for the ANC. I care more about low leakage so I'm not disturbing other people in the office. It's also why I wanted transparency mode, so I can still hear other people if they want something.",12/9/2022,AGJDE3TR26ZJIIR5CINP4GMUWLCA,1,11,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The only negative (if I'm being picky) would be that I've heard somewhat better noise canceling on other brands but in no way a deal breaker for me.My background is in mix engineering, thus making me hard to impress when it comes to audio products and I'm very happy with these headphones. The default eq curve sounds very pleasant with clean translation on all types of music. The low end is present without an unnatural boost, the mids are clean and defined, and the highs are crisp and silky without causing listening fatigue. The Soundstage is also wide with excellent separation.The app is intuitive with options for all aspects of the product. The only weird thing I've noticed is that boosting frequencies (such as highs or lows for example) using the eq has somewhat of a compression affect on the audio when pushed too heavily.

678,R2EMRYUEWAB9JV,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Too Much Low Bass; Not Ideal for Aircraft Travel,JCW2,4,"Really good sound, clean and clear with great frequency response. The one sad detail is WAY too much low bass. This is not to say it's bad bass, and it reaches much lower frequencies than most phones. It's tight and musical, but it's enough at the bottom end to cause audible distortion in higher frequencies during dense orchestral passages. (This is one reason speaker manufacturers use separate drivers for bass and treble.) I agree with the excellent review by M&N (under ""Other Countries"") except that only a 1 dB reduction in bass is not enough. These phones start to sound reasonably realistic on music with a lot of low bass after a 6 dB bass reduction (the max provided by the equalizer in the app), but I would prefer even more, preferably affecting only the very low end.Another problem potential buyers should consider is that there seems to be ZERO support from the manufacturer for this product. (Part of the problem could be that Sennheiser's consumer products division has been sold to a new company calling itself ""Sennheiser Hearing,"" so they might get this worked out in time.) So it's currently impossible to get operation and usage questions answered. Right now it appears that the equalizer settings are not applied when listening to a wired audio source. Since this is a major application of noise-cancelling phones -- think airplane travel, where Bluetooth is not allowed -- it constitutes a major drawback.Another issue for travel is the heavy, bulky case that comes with these phones. The phones themselves are reasonably compact, weighing about 10.3 oz, but the case is thicker and way stiffer than necessary to protect them and weighs a hefty 13.7 oz, more than doubling the total.Update 03/09/23: Access to technical support is improving lately, at least by telephone. When I finally got hold of them, I was told that, indeed, it is normal function that the phones do NOT apply any user equalization settings when used with an analog (phone-cable) input.",02/17/2023,AEPJX4BN6PLNQ7ZQPJYNDJBSBXCA,1,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
679,R10V36NAFXZEZA,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Wanted to Rate This Five Stars,Polarbear,4,"I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use.

682,R3CM2HXJ7D9U2D,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great, cut the noise and last the distance",Dave,5,"I researched a lot before purchase. I have noise cancelling buds which I love but in-ear for a long flight gets tiring. I've long been a fan of Sennheiser. These do not disappoint. They are not perfect at noise canceling, but they do remove background to the point I can enjoy music or movie while ""escaping from the plane"", yet not be oblivious to the flight attendant offering me dinner. They sound good - not the loudest but that's probably good for long listening. And I can use bluetooth with my Droid, or plug-in to the plane. But a key criterion was battery life. I literally flew around the world on a single charge. The tiniest quibble is the touch controls, which might do something I don't understand and have trouble undoing now and then.

684,R2BABA4LYTEDVO,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, iffy connectivity",anonamazon,5,"These headphones are among the best I've ever heard; their sound quality is unmatched in the area. Sennheiser is well known for this, and definitely live up to expectations here. You can tune them to your liking with an optional bass boost toggle in the app that makes music very punchy, which in my opinion adds a lot to these headphones.While the experience on mobile has been seamless with no issues, the same cannot be said for desktop. Periodically on desktop there is connection dropout with bursts of static upon reconnection.Notwithstanding the connection, this pair of headphones are my first with ANC. I think it works well enough, although from what I've seen it's hardly comparable to Sony's XM5s.The touch controls are sensitive, as many others have said. However, I don't find it to be much of an issue on a day-to-day basis. While having buttons would be nice, I find the touch controls to be rather intuitive and have come to like them.Overall, with the great sound and controls, I can easily say it's worth the price and more than makes up for the slight issues that you may come across when using them. I am more leaning towards 4 stars for this review, but in my personal opinion it gets a 5.",03/16/2024,AHWHDQ2NV7UMZ6CUMUT7GXH2FKTA,1,8,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
685,R3AI8P0NN1PNTR,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars The best headphones I ever used, and I’ve had them all",Thom,5,"Wow wow wow.Coming from the HD600’s I never thought I would hear better sound but these are just spectacular. These might be the most perfect headphones I ever used and I am absolutely an authority when it comes to headphones, as I use them 5 hours a day and have bought every model on the market for 20+ years.The sound is so very clear and I hear frequencies I never heard before in all my old music. Blows away the HD600s. Incredible. Flawless. No other manufacturer can match this, definitely not Sony or even Bose. The closest are the Apple studio headphones but still not really by a very significant margin. Apple did make some very clever in ear wired headphones in 2010 that are fairly close but no longer manufacture those. Forget airpod prosThe ANC is the best I ever heard as well, too good actually I almost got hit by a car. It’s kind of unbelievableNo issues with the bluetooth and it connects to two devices at once without any issues, switching automatically as the sources produce sound. Flawless operation and the app is simple and well thought outThe build quality is perfect. Design is very stylish and classy. Touch sensor almost never goes off by accident. Premium materials, super light, very comfortable I even fell asleep wearing themThe battery (!!!!) lasts 60 hours at full volume and these things can be loud. 60 hours! and they charge in about 1 and a half.So, perfection. PERFECTION. These are the best I ever had. In fact these might be the best headphones in the history of the EarthUpdate: Ok they aren’t perfect. What appears to be a firmware bug disables the touch controls randomly and you need to restart the headphones to get them back. Well, whatever. Still 9.999/10Update 2: So the firmware has two major issues.1) You are forced to disable the head sensor because if you take off and then put back the headphones too quickly it disables the touch controls bc of a bug. Unfortunately this means they won’t auto off and your 60 hour battery runs down continuously even without use and might as well be a 10 hours. Facepalm.2) The ANC setting resets every time you recharge and can only be reset from the app. This is deliberate IMO so they force you to keep opening the app bc it’s spyware",02/8/2023,AGNTDROPGCQOTPJUEENZL7KDDR2Q,1,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
686,RKREDCIKWK311,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally...one of the best out there!,James Irmiger,4,"I've been holding off on this review until I lived with these for a while. I got them when they launched and put them head to head against the Bowers & Wilkins, Sony XM4's and 5's, Master & Dynamic, and Dali...all ANC, Bluetooth, etc, etc.. I'll summarize as best I can.In -kinda- the same price range, they all sound good. The Sony's are muddy, the Bowers a little over equalized, the M&D are clear as a bell, but lack bass, and the Dali's are smooth as butter, but have poor construction (broke 2). Finally, the Momentum 4's are a touch bass heavy, but with a little equalization, that goes away and they turn nicely neutral.My biggest gripe was usability, not sound. The 4's have switched to a massive touch surface on the right cup. Normally, I don't mind newer tech, but OMG! Anything getting near them makes a selection. Hair, collars, pillows, you name it. After 7 months, they finally fixed it with firmware 2.13.18. You can now disable the touch controls, but you still can't adjust the sensitivity, or the stock control gestures. Ah well, can't be perfect, but they did also add a new automatic sound tuning feature that really works.I like the sound profile a lot, they're built well for plastic, they have a nice case, ANC is 80% of the big boys, but lacks their cabin pressure, mics are awesome for calls, and a big as heck battery to boot. Great job Sennheiser on the headphones and the updates!",05/10/2023,AERWA4ZHOEJICMKN4UV3W26IFM6Q,1,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
687,R12D0ZLRZ4AQC7,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars So Glad I Ignored the Bad Reviews!!!,HSPS2,5,"I was concerned about the number of medium/bad reviews but went ahead and ordered based on the many excellent reviews and Sennheiser's stellar reputation. After lots of reading, I came to believe that many of the bad reviews resulted from user error and perhaps compatibility/connectivity issues related to the often quirky Apple (iPhone/iPad/iHome) interface. After about one month of using the M4 headphones, I couldn't be happier. Yes, there is a learning curve with the touch controls and Sennheiser's app, especially for us seniors, but with practice, I'm now very comfortable and proficient. FYI, I use the M4's almost exclusively with my late model MOTO phone via bluetooth (android 12). Also, I have other high-end headphones for comparison. Here's what I really like about the M4's:The headphones updated flawlessly (about 25 minutes) right out of the box.The app installed and runs without a hitch - almost zero lag with all adjustments.The M4's connect immediately with my phone and the app, and stay connected.I've never experienced the mysterious ""turning on while in the case"" or when not wearing the headphones.Great Sennheiser sound for my music (Amazon Music). The rich, full sound with pleasant base is enhanced even further when I turn on Dolby Atmos Smart Audio in my phone's settings. (I thought the Sennheiser app might override this feature but it doesn't. I love the sound.)Call sound is very clear. Most people I speak with say they wouldn't know I'm using the headphones.Noise cancelling/transparency has a wide range of adjustment and I can easily shut out the noisy world - it's right up there with the biggest names in noise cancelling.Battery life is unbelievable. OMG, it never seems to go down!The oval, fairly large ear cups cover my large ears without problem.The understated look of the M4's is appreciated. I don't need to be a walking bill-board or get any attention in public.The carrying case is one of the best I've seen - compact, nice padding, stiff. Great protection!The headphones are comfortable to wear for a few hours. There is a little more clamping force than some others, but they stay put.Overall, a great purchase. Highly recommended.",04/3/2023,AEGBJZRGWXCSS5SKS3DHHWHSSDZA,1,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
688,R3RQ6GTUWPK41X,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 Unboxing and review,Mrs. Wendy L. Stefan,5,"The media could not be loaded. From the moment I pulled these from the box I knew I was in for a treat. They have a solid build quality and are lightweight without feeling cheap. The earmuffs are soft and comfortable even wearing glasses.Where these truly shine is sound quality. Right out of the box they sound warm and detailed. With minor adjustments to the EQ through the Sennheiser app they are truly delightful! I played some test tracks and warmed them up with some brown noise for an hour or so, however whether that is necessary or not is debatable.I have not tried calls with them yet but the noise cancelling is quite good. The settings in the app allow you to customize the ANC and unless it is set to automatically adjust, you can change the amount of ANC using touch on the right speaker.Touch controls were easy to use and function as expected. The headphones pause playback if you take the right cup off your ear which could be frustrating for some, but If you want to hear someone, slide the left side off your ear and the media will not pause.Definitely a high quality set of headphones built to last from a brand known for quality. So far I have not experienced any of the app issues others have mentioned. Firmware update went smoothly and took significantly less than the 22min it had initially told me it would take.I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone looking for a quality, well balanced and detailed sounding set of headphones. Does not get super loud would be my only complaint if I had one.

The audio quality was great, and the app was pretty good. I couldn't believe the 80-hour battery life. However, the mic seemed to pick up any and all background noise during calls. It was terrible—I couldn't use them at all to make calls. Additionally, the headphones had an issue where they would disconnect or turn off every 30 minutes or so.For these reasons, I had to return them.

690,R36ZIV2E3IZWRL,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite noise cancelling headphone,WT,5,"I recently added the Momentum 4 to my collection of noise cancelling headphones. The others I currently own are the Sennheiser PXC550, Technics EAH-F70N, Sony WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5. I don't have any Bose headphones because I don't care for their sound signature. For noise cancellation, the Sony XM5 are the best, but only by a small margin over the XM4. However, the XM5's adaptive noise cancellation cannot be turned off and for some, this is a big negative. There are people who want maximum noise cancellation all the time. Not just when they are in very noisy conditions. The Momentum 4 also uses adaptive noise cancellation but unlike the XM5, it can be turned off.For maximum noise cancellation, I prefer the XM5. Especially for long flights. I also carry the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for when I get tired of wearing headphones. In almost all other situations, I prefer the Momentum 4 and Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds for their ""nearly as good"" noise cancellation and superior comfort and sound. I prefer the Sennheiser sound because I find the Sony to be too bright for long listening sessions. They can be fatiguing for me. The Sennheiser sounds more natural, and the sub-bass is really good for a headphone. I also find the Momentum 4 to be more comfortable than the XM5 especially if I wear them for more than an hour or so.Random thoughts:The XM5 is louder than the Momentum 4.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are not as compact as the XM4 and PXC550 respectively.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are the same shape, but the Momentum 4 case is slightly smaller.The Momentum 4 has thicker earpads and are more comfortable than the XM5.The Momentum 4 sub-bass will rattle your brain more than the XM5.The Momentum 4 has an automatic switch-on/off feature that can be somewhat annoying at times. It can also be switched on and off manually.The Momentum 4 battery life is super long.",09/26/2022,AHZKXYBFWRA53YQ6TPGOZN3DQQEA,1,5,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
691,R39Z3XS2ONJTUB,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Volume is an issue,Evan,3,"For the price, I honestly expected more.These fit well, feel nice, and have a good weight to them which make them feel solid but not heavy. But for $350+ headphones, I expected more from the audio quality.Am I accustomed to a standalone amp and wired closed-back headphones? Yes. Do I use wireless headphones otherwise? All the time (mostly buds). Do these senheisers blow me away? No.The details in the audio is very solid, but where it lacks is sheer power. Do I intend to blast my ears at full volume? Absolutely not, but with ALL my other wireless headphones, I'm usually floating around half volume, while with these, I'm always a click or two away from full volume, which is crazy... I'm only 35 and have near perfect hearing, so something with these just feels off, like something an update could rectify to unlock a bit more volume capacity. I've heard others trying 3rd party apps to increase volume, which does work, but I find that an annoying workaround.The noise canceling is almost non existent, which I read prior to buying but I was still surprised at their lack of noise canceling ability. Ambient noise is audible, and this is why the volume is an issue, it's a vicious cycle.The touch controls work well but can be a little finicky, especially the autopause feature which stops music upon removing the headphones from your head.Overall, good headphones, but not amazing for the price and those who like to hear their music in louder environments.",12/1/2023,AEPQE6ZBDHU2PHPUNTN5CDBSPFNA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Never fails.Not only that, but it keeps cutting off for a split second as well. So annoying!Gotta make a phone call with them? Dropped call, or simply disconnects itself once again.

696,R2KLVLJ9CKHB23,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound. Disappointing build quality.,Robert,3,"The fabric on the top started separating from the headband after only a few months of light use (I rarely wear them anywhere except sitting at my desk). As a result, the very thing that gave these headphones a premium look and feel is now making them look prematurely worn out.I switched to the Sennheisers after a couple of bad experiences with Sony's flagship headphones. If the fabric stops separating where it's at now, I'll probably just live with it; but this is pretty disappointing for a pair of headphones costing anywhere from three to four hundred dollars!From what I can tell, it isn't that all units of this model are afflicted by this specific problem; but there are enough of them out there that there are mentions of it here and elsewhere. It's common enough that there are ""replacement"" headbands from China available online, but I'm not crazy about having to pry apart my headband on my own (and who knows what the quality of these replacements is?).I see that Amazon's added a note to the product page that ""this is a frequently returned item"".

One of my coworkers suggested I buy a pair of these instead. Price range is pretty similar when they're on sale so I bought a pair in white. They're super slick, very stylish, but most importantly the noise cancellation is AMAZING. I was walking to work one afternoon. For context, I pass over train tracks every day on my way to work. I was listening to country music and switching my song, staring directly down at my phone. I was completely immersed in my music with the noise cancellation on when I felt the ground shaking. I looked up to the literal train around 100 feet away from me. I had to sprint to make it off the tracks ALIVE. Long story short, noise cancellation in these bad boys is so good that I almost got hit by a train and died.

700,R10098H37FA770,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Are you Older? READ THIS.,Waydavis,5,"I am almost 65 years old SO, I DO NOT have the ears of a 18 year old. That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:A: Exceptional battery life.B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT’s - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450’s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My ""demo"" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call. People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL – REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing! I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison. I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they’ll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise. I heard a sample of the BOSE 700’s and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony’s.C: One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc. ALL gone with nothing playing through them!I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use. I’ve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)E: They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer. The EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings. Again, I remind you, I’m not 18. ;-)Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why? They started acting ""Funky"". By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal. ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially. I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.UPDATE 6-3-23: New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.UPDATE 2-16-24: Still working perfectly and I use them nearly every night to sleep.",05/4/2023,AFXILNJYGCIM3OBH4UNBTQTZVR2A,1,639,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

They're actually some really nice looking headphones.Sound- these are absolutely incredible I'm hearing notes and backup singers and different nuances in music I didn't know existed and I've tried four or five different of the top line pairs including the JBLs, the boses, and the studio beats pro.These absolutey beat every other pair I tried and it wasn't even close. If I had to rate them in order these will be number one, The beats pro would come in at number two, The JBLs were number three and bose would be dead last.Comfort: I can wear these all day with no problem My ears will not be hurting the headphones themselves are very plush and comfortable and I have a smaller head in comparison to a lot of the headphones I've tried and the adjustment sizes are really great no matter what your head size is. The only downside is of how insulated I think the inner ear cuffs are because it will make your ear sweat after a while because it keeps your ears pretty toasty.And coming up on the number one reason why I bought these, these by far have the clearest sounding calls of all the headphones I've tried people on the other line can hear me clearly I can hear them clearly the Bluetooth syncs pretty effortlessly.Even the custom sound profiles that you can access during the app make it even better.The battery life is pretty good I can go pretty much 3 days 4 days without charging on one use I would have to say you probably can get a solid 24-30 hours runtime out of them.Literally the only thing that could be better on these is since they are made by Sony you would think they would hook up effortlessly to the PS5 and it does not which is really annoying considering it's the same company. You can still hook them up via audio jack into your controller and it works fine but I just think it's ridiculous that Sony will not let it be Bluetooth compatible to another Sony product like that.Overall even though it's pricey I think it's worth it and you're not going to do better than these headphones.Yes I actually own this product and I paid full price for them I am not a reviewer In fact I hardly ever come on here to review unless something's really great or something's really terrible.",07/1/2024,AF5LHVZTV4NPWELGHZFV6XC3C4KA,1,4,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
702,R1JS47AJOJKY1K,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Overall the XM5 are the best,Scooley,5,"For some reason I’m obsessed with headphones so here is the most straight forward review to help you out.Price - They are all expensive, usually in headphones you pay for what you get.Sound - APM sound better, but you’re not gonna know unless you compare them side by side. XM5 sound amazing.Comfort - Super light and really comfortable. Headband doesn’t bother me at all. Trick is to expand the headband so it doesn’t rest on the top of your head that much. APM are too heavy, Bose feel slightly better than XM5.Features - They are the best you can get.Controls - Amazing, touch controls work great!ANC and Transparency - ANC is really good and on par or better than all other brands. Transparency on APM sound like you’re not wearing headphones, XM5’s transparency is much better than XM4 but do sound electronic, like you can tell it’s coming through the mic. It’s no APM but 2nd best for sure.Build Quality and Design - Plastic but that’s a good thing because they are lightweight. IMO they look better than anything else.Multipoint Connection - Set it up in the app and you are good to go with 2 devices. Stop playing on one device start playing on another. It’s seamless for the most part but sometimes you may have to reload the video or song to get it to play.Headphones are really subjective to the user. What I’ve learned is sound quality and comfort matter more than anything. There aren’t any headphones that are perfect and check all the boxes but the XM5 IMO are the best on the market.",06/1/2024,AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,1,14,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
703,R31L1M7XVZJ2HO,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Headphones,Melissa Follett,5,"What can I say, these headphones are amazing. The noise cancelling ability is incredible and they are definitely audiophile quality in the sound department. They come in a plain but nice protective case that includes a small 3.5 mm male to male jack and a type c to usb cable that is very short. The Sony Connect app really helps get the most out of these headphones. I just recently set up the 360 degree sound feature for these which really improves the sound experience on songs recorded with that feature. I also really like the equalizer included in the app. I use these headphones via Bluetooth from an iPhone 14 and the Amazon Unlimited HD app. Most songs sound fantastic and the volume is for the greater part sufficient. The majority of well sonically engineered songs are reproduced with stunning bass , smooth/detailed mids and extended highs. There are some songs that just are not produced as well and those can sound a bit anemic even with the bass on the eq maxed out. But this is a matter of the sonic quality of the source material and not the headphones themselves. I think the Bluetooth quality is exceptional and I can’t tell the difference between wireless and hardwired. I also plugged the headphones into my computer for testing and the volume went way higher then with my iPhone. It was actually louder than I could stand so these headphones can handle high volumes without noticeable distortion. I would not recommend listening at high volumes for extended periods of time if you value your hearing in the long term. I have not really activated or played around with the adaptive environmental features yet on the Sony app. Also, the phones mute when I talk and it pauses the source I am listening to. When I am done talking it resumes automatically. I am really happy with these headphones and feel they are a great value considering what they are capable of doing. I might also add that they are very lightweight and surprisingly comfortable to wear even for extended listening sessions. I had them on last night for 4 hours straight and although I knew they were on my head, they never felt uncomfortable or obtrusive. As a final note, I like their plain, unassuming look. I don’t need fancy looks, just give me top tier music reproduction and I am happy.",03/2/2023,AFIR77WLFKQIDZH6UNXBPMXPRUMA,1,18,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
704,R1SZPJ7YA17UMK,B0BXYCS74H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great ANC, Passthrough, and Audio Quality, but less comfortable and missing previous features",Kyle Zdunski,4,"I'm no audiophile, just a bit more picky than most people, but you can find resources online with exact specifications about the audio quality. They're certainly the best sounding headphones I've ever gotten.I own both the previous models, the WH-1000XM3 & XM4, and the quality of the sound, noise cancelling, and passthrough mode has gotten better with each iteration. The passthrough on these compared to the XM4's now feels lile night and day, as these allow me to hear my surroundings far better.However, I have had a few small issues with these. The redesign of the headphone strap looks and feels more modern with a higher build quality than the previous versions, and they're slightly lighter, but they're a bit more uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The strap is thinner, so the pressure on the top of my head is spread out over a smaller area, which begins to hurt after a couple hours if I don't wear a hat or hood to spread out the weight a bit. This is also somewhat avoidable by simply adjusting their position on my head every once in a while.One advantage these have over previous models is the ability to seamlessly switch between two connected devices, but this has it's issues. I use a Samsung phone and a Windows PC, so results may vary, but often the computer will just take control of the headphones despite not playing anything. For example, I double tap the right ear cup to pause something playing on my phone, then a few seconds later, do the same to resume it. For some reason, the headphones often decide to switch control to the computer during that brief pause window, resuming whatever was playing on it, or just doing nothing at all if nothing was playing. This happens even if all the audio on the PC is muted, no programs are open, and no media is or was playing.The XM4's had a handy solution for switching devices: NFC. I could hold my phone up to the headphones to quickly connect & disconnect it, making switching between devices quick even though only one could be connected at a time. I always knew which device the headphones were currently controlling. However, much to my surprise, the XM5's completely lack any NFC functionality. This would be fine, if connecting to two devices at once didn't have this issue. It's not a dealbreaker, though, as I just have to remember to disconnect them from my PC when I get up, or spend a few extra seconds getting my phone out of my pocket every time I want to resume something I was listening to.If you get these, here's a tip: don't clip your nails in passthrough mode. Something about the sound of clipping nails causes the passthrough mode to make a loud, high-frequency noise and shut off for about a second. This also happens for some other loud sounds, but clipping nails consistently causes it.In conclusion, I do believe that the XM5's were a worthy upgrade for me from the 4's. The improvements in noise cancellation are a godsend when there's constant noise around the house, which is all the time. I do wish there were an option to turn off the weird adjustments the ANC makes sometimes to try to adapt to the environment, as occasionally it will try to adjust each ear individually, resulting in a weird pressure sensation in my head due to the uneven audio cancelling.",01/9/2024,AGRX6WBOY2N4OUUYQ7WYTBZPZEPQ,1,25,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

706,R36XGSDG52PX3E,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony never disappoints!,Richard Huynh,5,"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes! I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.",11/24/2022,AG4AFQ2RC6MGWY2PL7QUCONDWZOA,1,213,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
707,R22XJZQKTNXP33,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Went back to my Bose 700s,Abby,3,"TL;DR: The sound is decent but not mind-blowing after you get the EQ dialed in. Before dialing in the EQ, they're very average and even a little muddy; definitely not worth $400 imho. They also creak ENDLESSLY while wearing glasses (not necessarily the fault of Sony but it did happen, it did annoy me, and I did return it for that reason). They sound very compatible to Bose 700s. If you choose to buy these, absolutely wait until they're $250 or less.About me: I am an amateur audiophile. I have 20 years experience being fussy about the sound that comes out of audio devices. It has to be at least good. I can't stand it when you're listening to something and it's muddy or obfuscated or doesn't give you the full sound because of inadequacies of the device. That being said, I don't know all the audio-related terms or specs and I am not an audio engineer.I read a ton of reviews and watched a ton of YouTube videos (especially from This is Tech Today) about these headphones. I am a longtime Bose fan, starting with the QC 15s, then the 35s, 35iis, and now the 700s. I used the 700s for almost 2 years before I started itching to know what else was out there. I came across This is Tech Today's multiple videos showcasing the sound of industry leading headphones, and I was horrified by how flat and awful the Bose sounded. Clearly I was missing out on a LOT.Price and feel----I bought these Sony XM5s at full price (long story, don't recommend it). My first impression after receiving them is that they certainly didn't feel like $400 headphones. MAYBE $200, but that's a tough maybe. The material is very light and eco-plasticky. They feel like that plastic that's designed to be biodegradable (I don't know if they are; that's just what it feels like). I was prepared for that based on others' reviews, so I didn't hold that against them initially.Comfort----When I first put them on, they were comfortable enough. After long wear sessions with my Bose 700s, I found the band to be a little uncomfortable on the very top of my head and I was worried these would be similar with the same form factor, but they're light enough that they are comfortable for long periods.Sound----At first, the sound was disappointing. Like all of you, I have certain songs I use to test sound from various devices and this was not giving me the full effect of these songs. I went to the internet for some EQ recommendations specific to the XM5s and this made a HUGE difference. They sounded pretty good.I no longer had my Bose 700s at this point (sold them to purchase these because I'm not made of money), but I used my partner's Bose QC35ii to test against. I didn't realize this until I went to test, but the Bose 35ii don't have an EQ setting in the Bose app. You get what you get. And what I got sounded VERY comparable to the EQ-adjusted XM5s. I spent a solid hour listening to the same test songs over and over with both, and while the Sonys come out just a little bit ahead, it's not a difference you're going to notice if you aren't directly comparing the two side by side. I wouldn't even miss it knowing about the difference if I had to use the QC35ii.Sony app----This app looks like it's from 2005. It's a little painful to use. I could learn to live with it, and it does what you need it to do, but it certainly isn't an easy or enjoyable app to use as of June 2023.The creaking----This is what did it for me. I wear glasses. I also wear headphones/a headset for 8 hours a day for work, and then another few hours for gaming in the evening. Without glasses, these creaked ever so slightly once in a great while. They're made of plastic so it's going to happen, and I could live with that. However, once I put on my glasses, the cushions against my frames creaked when I breathed. Or blinked. And if I turned my head, good lord the creaking. It was all I could hear, even while listening to music at inadvisably loud volumes.The verdict----I returned these and re-purchased the Bose 700s and I couldn't be happier.Again, I'm no audio engineer. I'm not claiming to be. But for me and my use cases, and my personal opinion on the value for money, I'm giving my money to Bose. I get more for less.",06/27/2023,AHF7JA3YLXY3XBZPWQ5JRAKZVQJA,1,45,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
708,R3JVU3MBWGBJ9Z,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Over valued headset - great, but not cheap - Extremely bad volume/pairing control",FD,3,"This is another great product from Sony. However is over priced.It has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.The downsides:Extremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).Noise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.Volume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!The volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.The issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.The device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model? Avoid this model or learn to spend more time to try to control it than enjoying your music !",02/16/2024,AGEVCQTW7JMPSDPC6QLZBMPPVCXA,1,6,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
709,R1Z5IQRHE12YL4,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics",Fresh and Felicia,5,"The media could not be loaded. I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.",05/24/2022,AFWWNMFZLULQLTUU7IM6PHHRLEFA,1,1369,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
710,R3IO6AFXH4Q3QQ,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones so much I returned my Senheisers for them,Tyler,5,"I initially bought the Senheiser momentum 4 when I was looking for a new pair of headphones. When I put them on, I was wildly disappointed because they didn't even compare to my old Sony 1000-XM3. When comparing those two I realized the XM3 had significantly better noise canceling, so I figured I should upgrade to the 1000-XM5. It is definitely an upgrade to the old pair. The sound quality is slightly improved but overall very good sound quality to the point where you start to dislike hearing music playing from other speakers or headphones. The noise canceling is top notch when combined with the sound of music or a movie playing. It makes the sound of the engines on a plane almost disappear, and any kind of ambient noise that you would hear in day to day is completely gone. Again this is also an improvement to previous models. Another great feature that is added is automatically powering off when it senses that they are taken off. This can significantly increase the amount of time you can go before having to charge again because older models would only automatically power off when the Bluetooth disconnected. In that case it wasn't really helpful for when you're wearing them to sleep.",06/30/2024,AH6G5XVJDUGNPG7KDDAPF736ID3Q,1,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
711,RM1Q7FEWXKB10,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Review After 2 Months,Andrew,4,"Quick take aways:Without an EQ, the headphones have a very very dark sound signature (I was not a fan)Sound very good for Bluetooth headphones with EQ, sound okay when wiredANC seems to be decent, lot of customisability in the appANC works well in standalone mode (without pairing)Battery life is goodNo form of sweat/water resistance is a minus but can be worked aroundHigh noise floor (if you care about that sort of thing)Optional pause with take off and resume with put on feature is amazing!As a preface, the Sony WH-1000XM5 are my first set of ANC headphones. I would consider myself a mild audiophile (I have a DAC, AMP, and too many headphones). With that said, everyone's ears are different so take this with an extra pinch of salt.Out of the box experience: The packaging was quite nice. It included a hard-shell carrying case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, 1.2m long 3.5mm cable, and the headphones. The connection process for new devices is wonky and leaves a bit to be desired. The initial pairing did not work until I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app from the appstore. After this, you have to power off the device then power on and hold the power button for 5 seconds to enter pairing mode (confirmed by a vocal ""pairing"" from the headphones). The sound signature left a lot to be desired. For a bit of background, my favourite type of headphone is flat/neutral with a balanced sound signature. I enjoy heavy bass in electronic music and am sensitive to loud highs/mids (I get listener fatigue quite fast from it). I enjoy a lot of variety when listening to music an will try most things out. In particular I regularly listen to Classical, Avant-garde, Experimental, Easy listening, Electronic, Contemporary folk, Latin, Jazz, Rock, and some Traditional folk. I don't tend to listen to much Blues, Rap, or Hip Hop. I occasionally listen to mainstream-Pop and Country.Without EQ, the sound signature is very very dark. The bass is very punchy and present, the mids are recessed, and the highs have their edge taken off. I was not a fan of it for anything but electronic tracks with no vocals and heavy bass. Even then, it wasn't particularly amazing. Anything with vocals will sound horrendous (again, with no EQ) as the bass frequencies in voices will be very pronounced. The ANC worked well for me out of the box. For the open mode, I set it to let near voices through and ambient noise out. I use them with eyeglasses but the ANC still seems to work well. They do a particularly good job of filtering out A/C noises, the electronic whine that appliances generate (not all people can hear this), and running water. The ANC tends to struggle with erratic high pitched noises (as I understand it, most ANC systems do). However, it will dull the noise a tad through both the closed back headphone and ANC component.Adaptations Since I was not a fan of the sound profile out of the box, I set up an EQ profile with these headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect app includes an EQ but I found it to be extremely limited in terms of customisability (I did not like any of the presets that were offered) and not very user friendly. Due to this, I set up my own external EQ using AutoEq (on github) as a starting point. After fine tuning it to my preferences, using the headphones became a much much better experience. They sound very good for Bluetooth headphones. For genres where I like more bass, I strongly prefer the Sony headphones over my Sennheiser and prefer the Sony to my Bose. In wired mode, the headphones definitely sound better but no where near as good as my other wired headphones. If I'm attached to a wire, I would rather just switch to another pair of headphones. With that said, they do sound better if you leave the headphones on while connected with a cable. The ANC works well for me. If I use them for noise canceling without music, it can get unsettlingly quiet in the mornings (which is a great thing). Around others, particularly in the kitchen, the headphones do a very good job of dulling and eliminating noises. The pass through function works well in the event of conversation. I am a very quiet eater but these headphones did a great job canceling out all noises while I ate. I don't use these headphones outside, so I do not know how well they perform with nature's noises. The gesture controls included are useful but a bit too involved to be my go to. If I have physical access to my device, I prefer to use that to control the music. However, the pause on take off feature is amazing! It consistently pauses my media any time I have to take my headphones off and resumes right where it left off and soon as I put it on. Simply magic is the only way I have to explain it (the function can be turned off if you don't like/want it).",03/26/2023,AE5DD5GYEJZMSBJWNIOSVPJ7VSUA,1,131,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
712,R6HAEDDWZFUC9,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise-canceling mic!,D. Johnson,4,"Negatives:The band is tight. I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.But that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.The app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to ""secure"" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.Positives:- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening. Speaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.It is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.I've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units: First, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered. Then I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition. But in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences. It's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private. These Sony headphones are exactly what I need.For me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake. - One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)",03/16/2024,AHIHTL4O3CIE2AWYZX7BF6KMG4RA,1,3,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
713,R1QDJ6PZICT8D2,B0BXYCS74H,2.0 out of 5 stars These had so much potential...,GarthVader,2,"There's A LOT to love about the Sony WH-1000XM5. I really wanted to write a rave review on them. Unfortunately I've also had a series of horrible problems that make them impossible to recommend.I'll start with the good. 1) These have the best ANC (active noise cancellation) on the consumer market right now. I also have Airpods Max and have compared with a freind's top of the line Bose QC Ultra. These put both to shame when it comes to ANC. It's incredible. Like so good it's almost dangerous.... I kinda worry I wouldn't hear a fire alarm going off while listening to music with these lol. I should note though, that to get this ANC performance you have to make sure there's nothing between the earpads and your head, like a hat or bunched up hair. My metal framed glasses don't make a difference, but my chunkier plastic frames let a bit more noise through 2) The battery life is amazing. I've been getting 24-28 hours of use with ANC on for each charge. They also charge fast - for me it's typically 45 minutes to go from zero to fully charged. For fast charging you do need a quality USB-C cable (I use Anker cables - they're excellent and very affordable). When I used a cheap crappy cable it took over 2 hours. 3) They're incredibly light-weight and very comfortable. I almost forget I'm wearing them. The ergonomics make them feel like they're custom made for my head and the ear pads and head band are the softest I've ever felt on headphones. The build is pretty plasticky, but they still feel well made / durable... and I think it's worth it for the weight reduction it allows. 4) Like any Bluetooth noise canceling headphones you're not getting hi-fi audio quality, but its better than most other bluetooth headphones. It's not as good as Airpods Max, but better than Bose and any of the cheaper bluetooth headphones I've tried. The most notable weakness is some muddiness in the lower frequencies, in my experience. 5) The case it comes with is awesome. It's a bit bulky, but it keeps the headphones very well protected and has a small compartment that you can keep a charging cable or 3.5mm audio cable in (which you can use for a wired connection if the battery dies, if the device you're using has a headphone jack). It's also very nice aesthetically. Overall the case puts Apple's Airpods Max case to absolute shame - that one barely covers half of the headphones, so it's worthless for protection. I'd honestly throw it away, but Apple is a dick and decided to make it so the headphones are always on and using battery unless you put them in their crappy case. 6) If you download the mobile app, there are tons of options to customize your experience. You can change the EQ, turn speak-to-chat on/off (disables ANC when it detects you're speaking to someone), choose your priority between sound quality vs. stable bluetooth connection, allow to connect to 2 devices simultaneously, integrate Siri or Amazon Alexa, customize controls, and a bunch of other things.Okay, now the problems. 1) A week after I bought them the speaker in the right ear started randomly making a loud buzzing/popping noise periodically. It's not all the time, but pretty frequent and very annoying. It happens for about 30 seconds a few times every hour of use. Sony claims it happens in places where ultrasonic waves are used to eliminate rodents and suggests you turn off ANC to prevent it... which is aggravating. ANC is the only thing that makes these worth such a high price tag and Sony is the only brand with that problem. Also, I'm 90% sure their explanation doesn't even apply to my environment. 2) Just two weeks after I bought them the touch controls started FREAKING OUT, detecting gestures when I wasn't even touching them. It rapidly flips between playing and pausing my music, skip songs, flip between enabling/disabling voice-to-chat, etc. all on its own, making them entirely unusable when that happens. It happens every hour or two, and once it starts it continues until I turn them off and back on. When I contacted Sony about this, they advised me to just disable gesture controls in the app. That prevents it from pausing or skipping my music, but it does not turn off the pinging sound the headphones make when a a tap/gesture id detected, so you still hear rapid random pinging whenever it decides to bug out. SUPER annoying. 3) 4 weeks after I bought them they just turned off on their own suddenly 10 minutes after I finished charging them to 100% and would not turn back on. I tried a factory reset and they still wouldn't turn on. after repeatedly trying to turn them on, they finally did... for a second, but shut down right after connecting them to my device. I figured they were completely busted, but when I tried again a few hours later they started working again and were fine for a few day... then it happened again. No idea what the deal is, but it's happened 4 times now, so I need to send to Sony to see if they'll fix them. Based on past experience trying to use Sony's warranty for repairs on other products though, they're probably going to send them right back and claim nothing is wrong because it didn't happen during their 30-second inspection.To summarize, these are SO CLOSE to being the best wireless ANC headphones to buy right now IMO. I really love them when they work... whenever I have to use my much more expensive Airpods Max, they make me wish I were using the XM5s minus all the issues. When they work, I prefer almost everything about the XM5 over the airpods. Unfortunately they're ruined by a few really bad problems. I would recommend getting the WH-1000XM4 instead. They have the same noise cancelling performance and most of the other great qualities and haven't been plagued with bugs. They're slightly less comfortable, but the tighter fit makes them more secure, which can be a benefit for people who want to wear them while working out.",12/16/2023,AEOTFW5HGJ2HINJMRI4WHHGKSN3A,1,27,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
714,R20WK709QH8M66,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely amazing.,Amazon Customer,5,"I used to own a pair of XM3s for quite a long time. I loved them so much. Bought them at about half the price than these. I wore those suckers out, accidentally broke them cause I'd use them to fall asleep and.. yeah, still worked but not the same. The price point on these XM5s is obviously super high if you know how numbers affect your bank account. I was kinda lucky because everyone I know for the past 3 years just gives me Amazon gift cards for special occasions (birthday, Christmas, etc) After literal years of browsing Amazon and not committing to using gift card money cause nothing sounded worth it, I finally purchased these. And still paid 150 dollars out of pocket. I have to say they are absolutely amazing. The noise cancelling is awesome (like incredibly good), the sound quality is... I pulled up a song on YouTube that I first heard 15 years ago (and still listen to it's not a memory lapse) and I swear I was hearing little details of the song I had never heard before. Comfy, awesome battery life, lightweight but doesn't feel cheap (better not). So short story long, even if I didn't have a slow build up of Amazon gift cards to help out, I would absolutely pay full price for these puppies. I absolutely love them.",05/14/2024,AF6RM3EVC4PKIHSUJD4PGY7C5V3A,1,2,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
715,R22CDFS457RMNX,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Audiophiles these are for you.,Angie-Marie Caldwell,5,"I am not an audiophile by any means, so I am sure there are things I am missing or go over my head. The sound quality is amazing. For the most part I could not hear things around me. If I turn them up they drown out the world. I am still figuring stuff out. I may do a part 2.Cons so far: there are no instructions. There is an app, but to me it was a bit overwhelming. I still do not know how to use the touch pad controls. They made my ears sweat after awhile. I had to turn off some options because I like to wear headphones above my ears flipped out. These hurt when I tried flipping the earpieces sideways.Honestly, for someone that does not have a trained ear these may be too much for me to handle. I might need a pair with training wheels.

I like that I can be connected to 2 devices at one time so if I'm listening to training online but my desk phone rings, it will pause the noise from the training so I can hear the ringing of the phone, answer the phone and then get right back to training once I'm done.

717,R39MN8FLS552NG,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Great quality but uncomfortable after an hour,User,4,"I've had this for almost a year now. The noise cancellation is okay. It isn't ground-breaking. You can still hear your surroundings if you concentrate.The sound quality is great. Now, is it great relative to its price? Probably not, if you're just an average, everyday person, which I am.Now, my biggest issue with these headphones is their comfort. The headphones feel lightweight yet high-quality. In the first hour, it's luxurious and comfortable. However, after an hour of use, the pressure on the top of my head as well as the sides of my head causes aching. I end up spending the next hour shifting the headphones forwards and backwards intermittently to avoid the aching on my skull.Only buy this if it is your dream to own these headphones.

718,R3C9FB6LLL4I7I,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Headphones are Mediocre,b,3,"*Disclaimer: I bought mine used ""like new"" or ""very good""I bought these because they're rated one of the best headphones on the market, I HIGHLY disagree. Are they bad headphones? No. Are they worth the money? No, not even on sale lol. I returned mine and bought the Sony WH-1000XM4, and here's why:**Noise Cancellation (6/10): This feature was ok at best. The Apple AirPods Max are still top of the line for noise cancellation - I hear nothing when I wear them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, I can still hear a lot of sounds around me. I'd say it cuts out maybe 60-70% of noise. My biggest issue here was that the noise cancellation would turn off randomly - so I would have to manually turn on/off the noise cancellation and ambient noise, which was just irritating.**Sound Quality (7/10): Sound quality was fine, it was nothing exceptional. The first day I received them, something really weird happened and the sound went completely muffled - like I was underwater. I looked up the issue and there have been similar issues for other customers who bought these headphones. The sounds went back to normal the next day, but I was already skeptical about their performance.**Comfort (9/10): I think they were really comfortable. I wear plastic framed glasses, so headphones that work with them can be a mission. The Apple AirPods Max do not work with my glasses at all, they pinch my frames and move them around - I need to wear contacts with them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, this really isn't an issue. I needed to adjust my glasses every once in a while, but maybe once in like 3 hours. I think they're one of the best fitting headphones for people with glasses. Also, when I went to adjust the headband portion to make them shorter/tighter, they would slip - they just would not stay adjusted to where I needed them (this could be because I bought them slightly used, so it could have just been from previous wear - but still an issue if they become loose over time).**Product Quality (6/10): The headphones themselves are cheap plastic and just feel flimsy. For almost $400, you would expect them to feel a little better or more sturdy. I was constantly worried I was going to break them. The case is nice and hard, and I personally think they store nicely and are easy to travel around with. I bought the beige ones (again, I bought them slightly used), but the case was dirty and it stains easily since it's made of cloth material. The foam on the ear part is very soft, so it's kind of just your preference there. I think they felt a little cheap, but I also think that they added to the comfort.**Battery Life (9/10): The battery life is fine, they last pretty long. I'm studying for the Bar right now, so I used them for about 10 hours a day. They would last like a little over 10 hours for me before needing to be charged, and charging only took max 3 hours.**Connectivity (5/10): I had huge problems with connecting them to my Mac, I have no clue why. But, just so everyone knows, you need to download the app (Sony Connect) to connect it to your phone and your other devices. They just weren't discoverable on my Mac. I restarted my laptop and the the headphones, downloaded the app, connected them to my iPhone, updated my Mac, etc. It took me like 2 hours to get them connected to my laptop. I'm not sure if I am just technologically challenged or if they just aren't compatible with Apple products, but this process alone made me feel rage that I never thought I would feel.**Aesthetic (7/10): The headphones looked ok on. The ear part was kinda too clunky for my liking. They stick out a little more than other headphones, so I kind of felt like a bear when I wore them.**Overall (7.5/10): I think the headphones are meh. I just wasn't impressed for headphones that are rated sooooo highly in every article online. I did a lot of research and was torn between Sony WH-1000XM5, Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 45. I decided against the Bose only because you cannot turn on/off the noise cancellation with buttons. So between the XM4 and XM5, I picked the XM5 because they were rated so well in online articles, I liked the look of them more (from pictures), and I figured I would just get the most up-to-date model. I returned them mainly because of the connectivity problems, noise cancellation, and sound quality. I just don't think they're worth the money, especially retail price. I just got the Sony WH-1000XM4 and they are SO MUCH BETTER. The sound/product quality, noise cancellation, connectivity, etc.Final Thoughts: If you want top of the line headphones and have the money to spend, get the Apple Airpods Max. If you want great headphones for a better price, Sony WH-1000XM4. The Bose are apparently SUPER comparable to the Sony WH-1000XM4 and are cheaper in price too. So, if having buttons to turn on/off noise cancellation is irrelevant to you, then get the Bose QuietComfort 45.The end.",06/13/2023,AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,1,76,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
719,R2NGQ3HUPCW8EU,B0BXYCS74H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad, but I expected a little better if I'm honest.",kcd,4,"I'm a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.",02/10/2023,AGWUCS3NKCOOQFWGTSA3JKVOMBOA,1,250,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

723,REW7IJXPA0PZ9,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this",Bast,5,"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.",01/18/2023,AFPONOVKTZQCDIHE5RWXZ7J5NQEQ,1,89,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
724,R16NN9RX85ZWB2,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Sound - but - Feels Cheap,Vinny9151,4,"Bought these to replace my aging Vmoda Crossfade II. Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will review them after trials.Update: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me.

727,R1YW8QI0C833VS,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.,Alex,4,"The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.I originally owned a pair of Bose 700 so my comparison is against them.BuildThe build of the MX5 is on par with the 700s. They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load. The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic. I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.Extra SettingsThe app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like ""Noise Cancelling 5"" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through. I'd like to be optimistic and say that sony can adjust these features later but they don't appear to be in the habit of adding features to the app. I also own a pair of the XM4s which are the in noise canceling headphones and I haven't notice anything new in the app since I got them.",05/25/2022,AFQGJAMQZAQF26CB2DVPM4VZVYEA,1,29,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
728,R1XVSTYW4Y4HBS,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony XM5 vs Bose QC ultra,Lori Fleury,5,I purchased both the Sony 1000xm5 and the Bose QC ultras to compare. I ended up going with the Sonys after lots of comparing and contrasting. In my opinion the Sonys noise cancelling was better although the Bose were good the Sonys were noticeably better in that aspect and I bought them for doing yard work/ cutting grass so that was very important to me. I will say I think the Bose out of the box had the edge in terms of sound quality but after messing with the EQ settings and researching what others were doing (thanks reddit) I was able to get the Sony headphones sounding just as good if not better than the Bose in the end. Both headphones are extremely comfortable and ergonomic. I did like the way the Bose button/ volume control setup was done more than the Sonys but that wasn’t a big deal to me. Also liked the way the Bose ear pieces were moveable making it very adjustable and easy to fold up into a smaller case. All in all can’t go wrong with either headphones both were great but like I said ended up going with the Sonys and are very very happy with them!,04/23/2024,AH6WPLK32FEJAXMM6ZLHQMKI4GIQ,1,2,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

730,R3T0GCTO01SV1U,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Impressive! But Just a bit overpriced!,Anthony S.,4,For what it is there's a reason they're the best headphones you can buy in the market at this very moment!Durability: I will say the Durability doesn't feel good to the hand but I do believe these will be fine as long if you take care of them. But be very aware there is NO IP rating!!! If you plan to use these for workouts and are worried about your sweat or rain ruining these be cautious due to there not being an IP rating.Included Case: The included case is nice. Glad one came with it due to the of course wild price. Be aware though these headphones do NOT fold like the previous version. So yes the case is a little more bulk.Sound quality and Noise cancelling: The Sound quality is decent to pretty good. I will say I wish the equalizer was better with added channels to change. Despite sound quality being decent/pretty good the Noise cancelling is king on these! Sony has been Kong when it comes to noise cancelling and you WILL notice this with these.Features/Gimmicks: Now depending how you see these you may consider them to be Gimmicks or features. The Auto Adaptive sound control is pretty good. It will automatically adjust ambient noise depending what you're doing and it helps a bunch! Another feature or gimmick is speak to chat which can work but also not work. I've had times where I'm talking and it won't activate till after 5 seconds and sometimes 7 seconds. A point where time is crucial when speaking to someone you might as well take off the headphones or put your hand on the outer part of the headphones to instantly activate the ambient sound. So in terms of the speak to chat feature it can be seen more of a gimmick.Value for Money: This is the part where your wallet will cry and hurt. These are super expensive for headphones I must say! But In terms of Value for Money. It's at a crossroads of yes is it a good value but also not. But I will say this. You're better off getting these on a good discount. I got these on an early black Friday deal here on Amazon. But I found out on November 9th it was at a price of $255 using a price history extension for Google Chrome. So technically this deal they had on these for Black Friday was a really bad deal. So my compulsive buyer syndrome got the best of me. Overall all for price. Wait till these are $270 or less I would consider that a better deal!,11/23/2023,AEQXWMMTSCAJRE3OJSTYSCCV3FTQ,1,7,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

734,RXP9X25616OKK,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Escape to silence and high quality sound,Thomas Volk,5,"I searched for the best of the best in noise cancellation, and these were consistently at the top of the lists. Short of putting some kind of physical sphere around your head lined with the foam they put into sound booths, I'd say this is it. It doesn't cut out everything, but I can't imagine a further reduction than these in the form of headphones.When you switch the noise cancellation on and off, you can hear the world again and see the difference. Someone can be standing right next to me talking, and it just doesn't get through. But a loud speaker nearby might still get a little through.Music sounds amazing through these headphones. These are the nicest headphones I have ever purchased, and listening to Spotify through these is like listening to the songs for the first times. I'm hearing delicate layers of sounds I didn't know were part of the song. The bass is rich but not forceful. I feel like I can hear everything in the song as it was meant to be heard while they created it in the studio.The only I miss from my prior cheapie headset was the physical volume adjustment knob right on the exterior of the headset. However, I'm usually listening to these on my cell phone or my Galaxy Tab A (like an iPad but Droid), and those DO have an external volume button themselves. So, it's only an inconvenience when hooking up Bluetooth to my Windows PC. In this case, I must have a little internal sound setting up on the screen to make it louder or softer, if the source content doesn't have a volume toggle like YouTube or a Streaming platform. Example is a game where the volume is set. Then I need the setting open.All in all, I'm extremely satisfied. They delivered on the best possible noise cancellation under normal circumstances. If you live next to someone using a jackhammer 8 feet outside your wall, perhaps you have bigger problems than these can solve! But the normal in-house noise, these should do the trick.",01/29/2024,AGMWATFS7EF7YD67666FGFMYVL3Q,1,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

737,R5OSWO113ZPKO,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Noise Cancellation Awesomeness,Kristin,4,"Up front, I apparently have a super sensitive head. ALL headphones hurt after a while. These are the least painful and I can wear them much longer than others. They do cause pain after wearing extended amounts of time, but I find taking breaks lets me wear them most of the day. The noise cancellation, especially on planes, is sanity saving. I just went on a trip and spent 12 hours flying and in airports each direction. These were lifesavers. Plane noise, screaming babies, loud talkers, they handled them all with ease. Do I wish they would pack up smaller? Yes. Do I still think they’re worth taking? Absolutely. The battery life is so good, I never have to worry about babying them. For the annoying but not deal breaking stuff…they drop phone calls pretty regularly (but sound really good on calls). If you plan to use them for a lot of phone calls you may want to try something else, but if you’re like me and mostly listening to music…you’re golden.",03/27/2024,AGLO7OXRGKQFJPP27YS5F5JV232Q,1,2,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

739,R2G3A1TQELK0FJ,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound on the Market - Overly Sensitive Touch Panel Issue Common,BeanDaddy,4,"I LOVED my XM4s. I upgraded to the new XM5s to let a friend buy my XM4s. Sound quality seems about the same - still the best on the market that I've heard personally. However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!",03/3/2024,AEA73WEVKLQR4Y5IYHR65D7FVP4A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
740,R31021WW6CLXL9,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to Bose NC700,mhans311,4,"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.",02/4/2023,AETTXELYLNOYOKPRX647FKJQO2NA,1,118,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

743,RD1KBOOEZR986,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Quality Headphones,Ryan,5,"I've had these headphones (which I bought refurbished off Amazon) for almost a year now and they're nothing short of phenomenal! Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the ""Speak to Chat Feature"" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!In the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones).",02/17/2024,AETTEEK3UFST3ZTMT5PN3WPGY6DA,1,1,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

It does hurt a bit because grip is tight, so I loosen it quite a bit.Cons:- On calls, noise cancelling is good but not perfect. Struggles with wind if not in a building.- Sounds quality is OK. Don't think it's much better than cheaper headsets. So if you're looking for WOW amplified/boosted sound quality, this won't offer that.- Connection sometimes randomly drops when I take my headphones off my head (with the pause on remove functionality OFF).- The talk-to-pause music function is a neat idea, but sucks because it stops audio when I'm trying to talk to someone over discord or zoom -_-",04/6/2024,AHCEY64LOOPD65UCACROSGKI7DZA,1,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

752,R2Y56TA2GYJYDC,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars It’s not 100% Noise Cancellation,Worm,4,"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced. Let’s see how long I can keep it alive.",01/16/2023,AFY2V4LYHK3EHFWUFTOKX7BMGDEQ,1,12,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I love heaving equalizer in the app. My friend calls from her gym, and there is a strong metal noise when people drop their weights. Was quite painful to my ears. I adjusted EQ and was able to talk comfortably.I still have previous model, the XM4, and I find that it is more comfortable to wear than the XM5. But I also wear them every day for at least 6 to 10 hours a day. My previous model is still working, but the battery life started shortening. It is not a reflection on the quality because XM4 is still working and has already 4 times the life of the original (not Apple) Beats. I even wear them frequently outdoors by a fire.In summary, these headphones are totally worth the investment and the sound quality is spectacular.",04/19/2024,AHTYPTUB32T6MVJTMMDSORZN43PA,1,1,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
756,RJAJFWZHN3W02,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the cost,M. Joy,3,"I read the reviews from those claiming professional audio experience with considerable respect and anticipation. I enjoy high quality music components - my taste has always been heavily rooted in 70’s Rock.As a drummer, and a serious music collector, I still enjoy the drive, spectrum, and talent that produces each part of the music - even though it is now rarely evident in today’s world of “noise”.I used a set of Bose QC35 headphones as my means of listening to music while mowing grass on my ZTR. These worked sufficiently while also giving an impressive rendering of music fidelity - all things being considered.After a few years I wanted to see if an upgraded setup was available - so the research, shopping, and review reading led me to buy these Sonys - despite that brand name not being one commonly associated with HQ headsets in the audiophile realm.Honestly - “overall” - It has been a disappointing decision made thus far. I get the feeling that the ANC is where the tech was implemented, not necessarily in the fidelity, styling, or sound drive.Other reviews adequately describe the somewhat cheap materials used. The lack of any manual buttons or controls on the set, coupled with the total lack of any printed manual is cheap IMO. Its case and packaging appear to be recycled - as a demonstration of Sony’s participation in the myth of climate change - so the tech stuff like “duo CPU and 8 mics” thing - gets a little drowned out.The folks at Bose use to piss everyone off in refusing to publish specs. They would reply “just give our speakers a listen”. And to a large extent - I think that applies here.These headphones do have a very good frequency spectrum , SNR, and although I have not thoroughly tested it yet - I’d bet the ANC works very well.The minimalist will love the flat black (or silver) shaved exterior. The one little paper included in the box (besides ads and the warranty) is a safety sheet that only lists ALL the MANY THINGS you should NOT do with them. Nothing is written inside to say how they can be used or enjoyed.You must download the “CONNECT” app, create an account, and use the phone app to set up and control the headphones. NOTHING is possible without doing that. (One more tether to tie you to your phone).Of course you read the terms and agreement when you open your account too - (and they wouldn’t dare use any of your PI, nor would your privacy ever be invaded).So I listened to the sound - and it is as good - perhaps a tiny bit better - than my Bose.But at a much higher cost - AND not until signing up & using the app to adjust the Sound. They are very lifeless without setting up the equalizer AND pushing the volume to FULL. This is a must.I’m not sure they even have the volume output of the Bose. That is a major concern to me due to my particular use - AND that I do like music to be fairly loud (and clear).Lastly, iPhone users - if you don’t play the game of getting the latest iOs revisions, certain functionality may not be provided. So iPhone users be sure to check on that.With such a price tag - and so many ties to endure - to gain and maintain full functionality with these, it may keep “fence sitters” like myself from returning them (after going through so much just to test them out).“Others” - who seem so thrilled - throwing 5 star reviews on everything they try, (and probably listening to compressed MP3 formats) will give Sony the goAhead on these. But I am not so thrilled. I like quality to be in all aspects of the equipment. And I like the USER to be in full control.There may be more to what Sony is getting here - than their customers.",03/21/2023,AEEZ24AWUXL2IA4UYFS6IUNU3PNQ,1,42,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
757,RLEMTFYFMDL31,B0BXYCS74H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent pair of headphones, but stay away if you need good sound quality.",Jacob A.,4,"For reference, used these for a couple of weeks before ultimately selling them. I found the ANC to be exemplary, and honestly the XM5's look amazing (in my opinion). Can't comment on the mic quality since I never used it, but I imagine it's quite good. Comfort was a bit of a mixed bag, it was in theory very good, but the narrow headband caused some discomfort after a while of listening! Now, onto the reasons I sold them: the sound quality is mediocre and said discomfort was annoying. Now, don't get me wrong: they would probably sound decent to most people. But upon unboxing them, setting them up, and spinning up Spotify, I felt my heart sink. The bass is very boomy and overemphasized, with little sense of control, and the vocals were garbled into oblivion. Overall the sound just felt incredibly unbalanced and unsophisticated, kind of like it was playing underwater. Now, obviously take it with a grain of salt: the sound is probably fine - it's not like it's unlistenable. I instead bought the Sennheiser's HD 560S and couldn't be happier. So TL;DR: Probably fine for most people. ANC is good, design is futuristic, comfort is decent. But if you really enjoy listening to music and appreciate it's beaty, you should definitely look somewhere else since the sound clearly wasn't tuned for and doesn't even come close to HiFi or audiophile level.",02/15/2024,AFUMFEXAJTNJ4FWRDQ6HUQPTYP3Q,1,31,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
758,R1OBPEA64NBXVG,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Simply amazing, and if you have the budget worth every penny",Nagisa11,5,"I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.The issues:I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.",07/2/2022,AFAR5DY57O62LVBJOJ5WZYNM57XA,1,78,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
759,R1FY80UDAMOOXD,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good with custom eq,Cj,4,"Update:I finally got in touch with Sony support and they sent me a new pair that are working very well. I skipped the current software update this time, and they’re sounding great.Original:I’ve used them for a few weeks now. They’re extremely lightweight, actually too lightweight for my liking. When handling them, they don’t feel like the price that they cost. The sound is just alright to me. I like that I can customize the sound based on my own hearing in the app called Find Your Equalizer, which makes them sound much better. The soundcore headphones are cheaper headphones, but their app does this feature really well, better than Sony’s headphones app. The noise canceling was great for two days. Then the headphones updated to the latest software, and noise canceling has basically been nonexistent now. I’ve not received support for this issue. The automatic switching feature between noise canceling and ambient isn’t the best. The most annoying thing now is that there is currently a high pitched ringing in the left ear that goes in and out. Resetting the headphones did not fix the problem as it did for some users. Only solution is to return them for a refund since they can’t be replaced.",02/15/2024,AHDUS4MLOG7II2YS3SYNPRC2HCPQ,1,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
760,R2MTCQRNNKYEXM,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect :(,Becca,3,"The sound quality of these headphones is incredible, and the noise-cancelling is absolutely stellar. I appreciate that there’s an option to let sounds pass through so I can hear my surroundings. Additionally, the app that goes with these headphones is pretty darn cool, and it’s nice to be able to change some of the settings from there. They connect to Bluetooth easily and quickly. They also look stylish—I love the color, shape, and matte texture of them, and the tap features are very convenient. The case they come in is also extremely nice.However, there are a couple problems.The most important problem:The cushion on top of the headphones flattened out after about two weeks of regular use. They’re very heavy, so without cushioning, they give me a headache shortly after putting them on.I could probably find a replacement cushion online, but it’s unfortunate to have to spend extra money to make them wearable since these were so expensive.The original cushion is so nicely attached, if I took it off to replace it I’d have to use a seam ripper. If I find a cushion that somehow slides over the original one, it won’t look as sleek and smooth.As a young person, this was my first time buying a very expensive item for my enjoyment, and it’s a massive bummer that it became literally painful to use after such a short time of having it.A much less important issue:It makes a little alert sound every time you tap on the left side of the headphones and there’s no way to change the volume of it. It can be annoying/surprising if you accidentally tap it, especially if you’re listening to something quiet.I can easily deal with an annoying tap sound, but not being able to wear them without headaches is a dealbreaker. I wouldn’t have bought them if I knew.They’re such high quality headphones in almost every other aspect, so it’s extremely disappointing that they’ve become so burdensome to wear.",04/23/2024,AEB3ZYZ7K27FLS4GLUKPCLX3TJVQ,1,1,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
761,R3E5YBYLC2JL87,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome!,Jonus,5,"I bought these before I was to go on a 8h flight, worked awesome! When you put them on and hook them up to your phone they don’t 100% block out all sounds but you definitely notice a difference, obviously with music on you can’t hear anything else. Some people I read get a feedback noise when first putting them on but I don’t notice at all. I love the feature that detects your voice and turns off your music so you can have a conversation with someone. Also if you need to hear some you just put your hand up to one side of the headphone and it will also pause your music. I don’t use many other features as sometimes when I would adjust the headphones it would think I wanted to skip a song.These are awesome though for working out or flying, just blocking out chaos if kids as you clean lol.",04/18/2024,AFDCSDLNVBFDQA3NP5M36QQFZVZQ,1,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
762,R2OA6TGYZGNBOZ,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Practically exactly what I wanted,Joshua,5,"The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though, is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking. There are no boundaries in the world of music, and there certainly are not limitations to reach that boundless world inside these headphones.",09/10/2022,AEOV73IEEBQE3D2CLMDT4LF5REYA,1,39,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

The noise cancelling ability of these new Sony headphones is incredible- my previous headphones just masked the sound, and I had to play my music at max volume to be able to hear it. The new Sony is so good I can play anything at a comfortable volume and hear it clearly. However, they are very glitchy- if I clear my throat, or cough, or mumble to myself, they apparently think I'm talking and the noise cancellation stops. There is a warning not to wear them while sweating, and I can confirm that they are very glitchy when sweating. My previous Sony I could wear in the pouring rain.

766,R3T2XF3BZ94M5T,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars ANC is still lacking,Adam King,3,"I know people like these. I'm in airports weekly and got these to dampen the chaos in crowded places. I chose this product because it supposedly has best ANC available. They are comfortable, long battery, etc etc as described, but I'll focus my review on noise canceling capability.In some cases they work pretty well, but they tend to cancel what I don't mind hearing anyway while letting irritating or distracting sounds through. I've tried earplugs under them will little added benefit. Playing a music track fairly loudly will drown out residual noise, but so will any traditional headphone. I seek a sound reduction device.What they DO cancel well:Engine noiseWind noiseAirplane engine noiseWater running soundSizzling/simmering sounds from kitchenWhat they DO NOT cancel well:Crying babiesMusic in restaurants at airportsFlight attendant intercom messages (usually cranked to truly damaging audio levels)Chattering American passengers who just made a new best friend (there's always a pair)(this also applies to the ego stricken businessman who seemingly wants everyone in the terminal to know he's a businessman)In general, if you want to block out people sounds...these just don't do it.What I desire (especially for $400+) is ability to go offline if my eyes are closed and hear only a dull roar...something these headphones actually do suppress very well.I think when someone develops a truly effective ANC system, users will enjoy a new sense of peace and freedom in chaotic places. It's really less a matter entertainment and one more of mental health. I'd pay more than $400 for that.",05/7/2024,AHNCUSUEGNPZ37UDZSAAGQDSE6XQ,1,3,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

However, to put the headphones back into the case, they had to be fully un-extended, which means every time I took it out I'd have to take some time to adjust the length again. Speaking of the case, the magnetic cable slot from the Bose headphones' case was nice and worked perfectly. The only complaint about the case is probably the zippers consistently get stuck near the two ends. To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones. Personally, I thought it was slightly dull/dark with default settings and wasn't massive improvement from the previous gen. The EQ in the app did help tremendously and clearly reflected the changes I made and it was able to tune to my sweet spot. To be fair, I'm no expert in audio so take this solely as an opinion base review.In terms of the ANC, Sony nailed it again and it blocked pretty much anything... Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars. The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints. First of all, the quick attention mode is a great feature but it would only work on the right side of the headphone as almost all other features on this headphone. All touch controls are on the right earcup while the left just has 2 buttons for ANC/AMB and power plus the wire jack. It'd be nice if there was the option in the app to choose which side the touch controls are on or just make it work on both sides. This is not possible and understandable if there's never a panel to do touch control on the left but that's probably good thing to add for the future. Also, I'm aware that I could literally just flip the headphone(as they seem to be identical except for the buttons) and wear the Right on my left year, but why?Anyways, moving away from the left and right issues. Something minor would be that I'd personally like to customize my touch controls but that didn't seem to be an option in the app as I've looked in and out for it. Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly. I'm thinking it's more of an issue with the devices that I'm using(iPhone and iPad) which don't work exactly like devices in the Apple ecosystem. For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad. To make it change devices (I've tested it multiple times), I need to pause the audio on the current device in order automatically move to the other device. This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?).Perhaps some of these issue could be fixed by updates perhaps not. I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless. I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy. Don't get me wrong, it's great and all, just not worthy as an upgrade.",05/22/2022,AH3X5TK4L57XIHVIRZ7HAJGCBHVA,1,9,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

780,R7AKSHV4291D9,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, cheap construction. So I’m still on the fence.",Chuck1998,3,"Ok, I’ve had these for about 72 hours and as my title said, I’m still on the fence to whether or not I’m returning these.The PROS:*The ANC (active noise cancelling) is unparalleled in my opinion. Standing near my sink with the water running, and music at a very low volume, I couldn’t hear the faucet running. Like, at all. Even without any music playing, the ANC is amazing.*Great audio. I don’t know how it picked the song, but once connected to my phone it started playing the most chill and quiet slow beats of a song I’ve not listened to in a long time. I’ve never heard the song with such clarity. Flawless first audio impression.The CONS:*I gather that maybe they engineered these to be lightweight intentionally, as to not weigh down peoples heads for obvious reasons, but…I thought at least the circular part where the ear cup joins the bridge, would be metal, or metallic…but nope, plastic. It’s all plastic. And not just high density plastic, it’s that cheap low density plastic stuff. Like the cheap plastic you’d find in the cheapest toys section of a toy store. The entire thing feels…disposable. As if you get them for free when you board an airplane for a flight. After spending $400 on this, and opening the package, I INSTANTLY got a bad feeling it in the pit of my stomach, like I was ripped off by something on Alibaba, or Wish. These feel like disposable trash, folks. Which is the only thing making me contemplate whether or not to return these. I have a few weeks with Amazon prime to decide, so we’ll see. Like, usually with good tech you can feel the quality - either the specifications or the hardware. I can’t say that with these. They feel cheap. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯*This is a minor issue, but it irks me a bit. More of an FYI to you all. I have the black version. It’s matte black. Like that velvety smooth kind of matte black. Well, if you have oily skin, you might have a bad time. Unless you wash your hands obsessively before touching these…finger print magnets. Finger prints get everywhere. Instantly. I’d personally prefer smooth shiny plastic, as that coating will last longer (that matte coating WILL get scratched), and the shine of hard plastic wouldn’t show the finger prints everywhere. But anyways, that’s minor, and nowhere near as bad as the con of them feeling cheap.That’s pretty much it! They do an excellent job audio wise, but despite knowing that, I still feel like it’s throwing money away. The audio trounces my Air Pod Pro’s (and their ANC) by a mile, and I’ve not tried the Air Pod Max’s. But because they feel SO cheap, I feel like I’m getting ripped off. The case is nice tho, so they do lay flat - as you can see in people’s pics.I’ve not charged them yet, and I’ve used them loads…so I’m assuming their 30 hours battery life is legit.If you have Amazon Prime, go ahead and order them. You’ll have to gauge for yourself how you feel about the lightweight plastic’y feeling. If you don’t have prime, I’d hold off, try to find them in a mall or something to try out.It’s disappointing when you’ve been waiting for a model to come out for so long, and then you’re left…unfulfilled. I’m gonna keep the, for a spin for a few weeks, and we’ll see. Good luck in your purchases!",06/2/2022,AEH3XHDJXFRIHJGN46FBYGKZMAQQ,1,6,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
781,R3BP1X84ZCJS0R,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, but I expected better",Scott Duckworth,3,"I upgraded to the XM5 after owning the XM2 for many years. I used the XM2 for 6 to 8 hours per day most workdays over the last 4-5 years, and I've done the same with the XM5 over the past 2 months. I also occasionally wear them while traveling by plane.The XM5 is good, but it let me down in four notable areas:* Noise cancelation for the wearer: Sometimes these things can't make up their mind about which noise cancelation profile to use. This results in a noticeable and distracting changes in the background noise that I hear. The issue has occurred when I'm sitting in an airplane seat in very mild to negligible turbulence, and also occurs when I'm sitting in a slightly bouncy chair. This happens whether or not Adaptive Sound Control is enabled. I don't mind if the noise cancelation profile occasionally changes and I can hear it, but this sometimes happens maybe 2-3 times per minute. Noise cancelation of the XM5 is maybe a bit better than the XM2, but at least the XM2 was consistent.* Noise cancelation of the microphone: This was the main selling point that convinced me to upgrade from the XM2, but since switching to the XM5 I've had more occasions where the person on the other end of a call couldn't hear me well and I had to revert to my phone or laptop microphone. I can't tell if this is just correlation or causation.* Battery life: It's good, but surprisingly no better than what I was getting with my XM2 with its 4+ year old well used LiPo battery. I typically go 2-3 full workdays without charging them, and will get low battery warnings around 4 days.* The material used on the earmuffs is squeaky when rubbing against my glasses. This is not a problem if I'm perfectly still, but just the slightest motion of my head causes the squeak. This didn't happen with the XM2.On the plus side, USB-C charging is nice (though that existed since the XM3), they are a bit more comfortable than the XM2, and being able to simultaneously pair to two devices is nice. To my ears, the music sound quality is about the same between the XM2 and the XM5.Overall, I wouldn't say that either the XM2 or the XM5 is better than the other, but I'm giving it 3 out of 5 because I expected that the XM5 would be better than the XM2. None of the issues are deal breakers for me, but all together they make the XM5 border between underwhelming and disappointing.",02/14/2024,AH2X7RQUMWRPJKUKDSGMUUIRTUAQ,1,2,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

783,R1Y12WYNN30ZOY,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Hao Phan,4,"Sound quality and ANC are phenomenal compare to the airpod pro max (I do own 2 of them). I had my AC on in my room, it's pretty loud, even I can still hear a little bit of noise after putting on airpod pro max. However, when I use the XM5, the noise is completely gone, it feels like the AC is far away.Unfortunately, I had to return it because I tend to sweat a lot when gaming or working out. So if you're someone who live in a warm temperature room or go to the gym a lot, this will not hold up. I really hope Sony will make the next Gen XM6 with IP65 or higher because the leather on XM5 holds a lot of sweat. Another reason I had to return it was because the headband isn't quite comfortable. Even though a lot of tech youtubers say the cushion is thick on the headband despite its slim size, I still hope they would stick with XM4 headband cushion design. My head got really hurt after an hour of using it, feels like there's a dent on my head every time I after I use it. I've also read a lot of comments on forums like reddit, sony, and reviews saying the headband and design is very narrow making the top of the head hold the most weight. In addition, because of narrow design I can never find the good balance. If I set the headphone too tight, top of my head gona hurt, but if I set it too loose it does solve the hurting head issue but it will fall off.Another con for this headphone is the ear cups, I wish they would've rotated inside instead of outward when you rest it on the shoulder. Overall, I love the sound quality, ANC, and the smooth swipe controls. I hope for the next gen, XM6 they will add more padding, stronger point on rotate area, and please for the sake of God please do water resistant IP65 or higher. It's 2023, technology is so advanced now, I know they can do amazing things not just some cheap recycled plastic.",08/4/2023,AFGXPRMASAAHFICOEBNKCAYARTHA,1,20,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
784,R1ADKUSAWBANNE,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Surpassed expectations! Excellent for noisy apartments,Mike,5,"These headphones are a life saver! I live in a noisy apartment. My neighbors below me feel the need to blast their home theater stereos at all times of the day and night, and I wasn't expecting much from noise cancelling headphones considering how obnoxious the noise is, but on a whim I gave these a try.It's been a few days and I can confidently say that these Sony headphones work wonders! They are fairly lightweight, and they sit comfortably on my head for hours on end. The cups are soft enough so your ears don't feel squashed, and at the same time they do allow for decent breathability. This means my ears don't get hot after extended use, which was a common issue I had with headphones in the past. The headband is relatively comfortable as well; it doesn't dig into your skull once you figure out a good position for the headphones, though it might take a few tries to find that sweet spot.Sound-wise, again these headphones are top-notch. I'm no audiophile by any means, but they sound fantastic when listening to music or taking calls. The noise cancellation features work practically flawlessly. Even when my neighbors are making noise, the headphones cancel all of that out and reduce it at best to total silence, or (rarely) at worst, a very faint mumble. I noticed this tends to work even better when you have music playing, even at a low volume, in which case outside noise is completely negated. I also wear glasses so there is a small gap in the fabric of the cup which tends to let a tiny bit of noise in, but again it's barely noticeable especially when I'm listening to music.The volume controls on the cups are convenient especially when you're not by your computer or phone. Double tap on the cup to pause or resume audio, and swipe up/down to adjust volume. The microphone is fine; I haven't heard any complaints from others when I'm speaking during a call. Overall the connection quality to my computer is stable even with the unusual amount of Bluetooth interference in my apartment building.In short I highly recommend these headphones. They are a bit on the pricey side, however in my opinion it's money well spent if you're looking for some peace and quiet with a solid audio quality.",11/24/2023,AFT2KG66YHH4DCACIM3Q5D4AQWTA,1,44,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
785,R1S9HWH5G3GAYN,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones missing key features,Tyler B,3,"I use these headphones nearly every day. The most important parts are good - solid sound quality, reasonably clear microphone, great noise cancelling. I also love the volume and tracking swipe feature on the right ear. That said, the lack of a dedicated mute button is a big downside. Additionally, there is a speak-to-chat feature that automatically paused noise cancelling when you talk. This would be nice if it was optional, but it turns itself on even if you turn it off in settings. Presumably they could fix this in the firmware but have chosen not to. Finally, the materials feel extremely cheap for headphones at such a premium price. I will most likely not buy from this series again.",06/18/2024,AFWZCOKK3SRTITJX4DUYWS3XJ6JQ,1,0,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
786,R1AFI492PB673E,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable to wear, but noise cancellation could be better. Battery life is great.",Zen,3,"I purchased these headphones as I was going to be on flights for about 50+ hours round trip. Two of the flights were 16 hours long each and I had hoped that these headphones will provide the noise cancellation so I can sleep. After reading so many reviews, I was hopeful that they will cancel out almost all of the noise on a plane. However, I found that this was not the case. I was able to hear almost everything like crying babies and people talking loudly, it muffled the sound, but it was still loud enough for me not to be able to sleep. They did drown out most of the plane ambient sound like engine noise. When I used them with earplugs in my ears, they helped cut out most of the sound. So that’s what I did for the plane journey where there were three crying babies around me. If I listen to music with these headphones on, then they definitely cut out more sound than when I just run the noise cancellation. I had downloaded the app and tried to adjust the settings on that for better performance, but did not notice a big change. I don’t like using earbuds like AirPods, but I find that these are barely any better than my AirPods 2. They are very comfortable though, and I prefer them over the bulky AirPods Max. The sound is also pretty decent, but my main purpose was noise cancellation and it was a bit of letdown.The battery life is truly phenomenal and lasted my journey of 25+ hours, with just one charge. They get sweaty only after multiple hours of usage, but better than anything else I have owned, these are the only headphones I was able to wear for 6 to 7 hours straight. I will carry them on any longer plane journey because they are better than anything else I own currently, but for this price I had hoped for even better noise cancellation.",02/24/2024,AHZAAOPTGKDWVSXLIKHMUUPYN52Q,1,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I bought them, used it for a year, then sold it. It was too heavy, it was too expensive, and the lighting port fiasco Apple is on should be illegal.I truly regret not buying this. It’s lighter, has more sound controls, it’s less expensive (~$200) oh and it has USB C charging. Also the “Headphones” app has a built in equalizer; meaning you can have more bass or making things sound more chill.Apple’s marketing team is from Capitalism Hell. They will suck you in. Make you think you really need it but it lacks at the things you aren’t able to write down when you are in the moment. The bottom line is you don’t really need all of Apple’s “magic”, “seamless” tech. There is beauty in connecting the Sony headphones to your devices.Take it from me with less money in my pocket.Go with this. The Noise Cancellation is on Mute. You won’t hear 💩.Stop wasting your time and money and buy it now. Also the fact that it comes in a protected case is a no brainer. Excellent Job Sony! I can’t imagine how to make these better.

791,RMR8RSITTWN5H,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for noise cancellation, problems connecting with Teams chat",Amazon Customer,3,"I bought this headset to replace a pair of Bose QC 35 ii I had previously used at work, as the bluetooth kept failing and the sound was starting to have issues.I've owned the Sony headphones now since the end of Nov 2023, which feels like a decent enough time to give a well informed review of the product.Pros: Excellent noise cancellation. The location based customization is fun, but ultimately when I'm wearing these I'm at work and pretty much just need as much noise cancelled out as possible to avoid distractions. The music quality is also nice, though my main concern for headphones was to be able to focus in a noisy office setting.Cons: This headphone has issues working with teams video calls and zoom. I've looked through tutorials and troubleshooting to fix the settings, but I'm having to fix the settings before EACH call to make it work. I would suggest either getting a separate headset for those video calls, or consider another option for headphones. This was never an issue I experienced with the Bose.The headphone case it came in is nice, but I had problems with the zipper immediately. It's been incredibly frustrating having to struggle with a faulty zipper just to get my headphones out so I can start my day. I've already had to undo part of the seam to reset the zipper twice, and will likely just replace the case or attach some velcro to keep the case closed. I have a hybrid work schedule, so having a semi hard case to protect the headphones matters to me.In sum, if your main concern is noise cancellation and you have infrequent video calls, I would strongly recommend this product.

Bridges,5,"I tried the xm5 earbuds and they were not good for a few reasons, all deal breakers, mostly the right bud cut out. So I was skeptical about these over the ear xm5's . I bought them used for 217usd, half price. Noise cancellation is better than xm4, but that's not a strong suit for me, i'd just as soon have a bit of ambience, just my preference. They are loud enough, which I have only found in xm4 and these, 5. Almost dangerous loud. they are tighter on the ears than xm4, I probably could not wear them all day long, esp in summer, but hours with no problem. And they are comfortable as the xm4's but a bit tighter fit for sure. Really excellent headphones. They are bluetooth but have a cord attachment too, in case you need a wired in. Weird, but I guess it's useful to someone. I was most concerned with the rotating muffs, that they would break easily, but it's a really solid build, not to worry.

794,R27ZKHWXTP4NZL,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Product review after one year of purchase,Amazon Customer,5,"I purchased these headphones exactly one year ago. They are my first ever headphones. Here is my review in points:1. They’re very light to have on your head. I am a visibly Muslim female, meaning I wear a hijab. So I was weary of the pressure of having the headphones on top of my hijab, but it’s all good! Obviously if I have the headphones on with or without the hijab, for over an hour I’d say, my ears get heated and I have to take a break.2. They look really nice, very well made. I got the grey-beige color. They’re not bulky at all, which is something I like.3. The headphones length is easily adjusted.4. The noise cancellation option is great. Let’s say you’re in a room filled with people and a loud TV is on. Which is the case in every lunch break I have. When I put the headphones on with the noise cancellation option, the voices don’t “disappear” but they become super distant that they don’t bother you anymore.5. I use mine an average of 1-1.5 hours daily and the headphone power lasts about 3 days. I think 30-40 minutes of charging is sufficient for a full battery.6. You do need an app installed in order to do anything with the headphones.7. One downfall I’d say is that I can only control the volume via my phone, not directly through the headphones.Overall, I love these headphones and would recommend them to anyone.",01/31/2024,AFEDD5I56GUQZJ4BC7S2C4MIJJZA,1,14,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

796,RBJU0LP5HBUFA,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Incredibly comfortable and versatile headphones. Okay sound.,Laurent Park,4,"I got this looking for a replacement for my AirPod Pros -- I would use them for work calls and for listening. My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC. I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:Pros:- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening. These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I am able to last a full 8 hour office job wearing these without too much sweat or heat, and the pressure is perfect. No headaches from wearing them all day, and it's overall been absolutely perfect. In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.- Battery life / charging is amazing. 30 hours may be the industry standard but whenever I'm low, I just give it a charge for five minutes and I'm basically good for the next few hours.Cons:- I listen to a variety of music from hip hop and mostly electronic music. For songs with more emphasis on acoustics and vocals, the headphones are pretty good. However for my electronic library it leaves a bit to be desired. The bass and sometimes mids feel very muddy, and no amount of EQ I use can get it to where I like for all my music. This is where AirPods Maxes shine out. They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all. You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.",02/4/2023,AF7I3NXH5RWRFSMW2JWBTWAIT5MA,1,7,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

800,RBAZBP0AEJ7MI,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars A Bargain at this Price point,Theraphosa,5,"I've had these earphones for a month now and I feel like they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever owned. My previous ones were an older model Bose and then a comparable Sennheiser.My job requires that I do inspections in various industrial facilites.My initial work is about five hours in an office, but the decibel level is still around 70dB. At that level, the Sony WH-1000XM4 remove about 95% of the ambient noise. Music, computer videos and telephone conversations are excellent. These headphones are very good at that level.I next spend up to four hours inspecting out of the equipment floor. The noise level varies from around 78dB to 82dB. Not painfully loud, but it can cause short term hearing damage in short sessions, but 5hrs/day on a regular basis can permenantly affect your hearing. To give you a reference point, you would have to shout at someone standing about 3ft away for them to understand you. So it's not jet engine loud, but it's uncomfortable and in addition to hearing damage, long term exposure can raise your blood pressure and cause other negative effects on your physical and mental health. And yet, the level at which OSHA requires hearing protection is 85dB.All this is to say that I take sound cancellation seriously, and I also take my music seriously too. These earphones are great on both fronts. I'm very comfortable at work and I can listen to my playlists and don't feel as if I have to turn up the volume to drown out the noise of the machinery. It's really pretty cool.My total shift is about ten hours, and I feel no discomfort wearing these over my ears. I'm also bald, and there is plenty of padding on the band where it contacts the top of my head. I'm very happy with these, and even though I've spent more for earphones, I've never had a better pair for my needs.The only downside is that they are not great when using them to make phone calls in a loud enviroment. I honestly didn't expect them to function great in that respect, but it would have been great if they did.The app has numerous ways to customize your experience. More than I actually use. The adaptive sound kept changing the noise cancellation as I moved, so I turned it off. The Speak to Chat feature could be handy, but I occasionally sing along with my music and it would switch off the cancellation. So I turned that feature off also.PROS:Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.Very good sound cancellation.Love that they pause the playback when you remove the headphones.Great that just holding a hand over the right ear cup will turn off cancellation so you can have a conversation without removing your earphones.Very good music reproduction. Bass is not quite true, but if it was really pronounced, I could adjust the equalizer.The app is very good and has a lot of features, I was pleasantly surprised even though I don't need or use many of them. It's very helpful.Love the ability to stay connected to two devices at the same time. My phone and my computer work well with the earphones.Cons:Sometimes I wish they were a little more snug (maybe I have a small head?)The app is almost TOO helpful. It can take some trial and error to get everything set up as you like it.I would prefer a more tactile controls. These require that you sweep a finger over the outside of the ear cup for volume and track control. It's actually very accurate, but I would still appreciate something that I could use while wearing gloves.Overall, these are a total win, and a bargain at the price. You could probably get something just a shade better, but it would be at a significantly higher price. These are perfect for me and my situation. I would defintely buy them again.",04/11/2024,AGLZUTDNQGTB7SYDWEKICNA7753Q,1,75,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
801,RN9CWLAVNRL0V,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Better Than XM5,b,5,"**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max. I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.",06/20/2023,AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,1,696,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
802,R1RRDWF3JCZOPG,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars What world?,FaTHoM,5,"After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately and are fantastic for instrumenal music.For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.",11/13/2022,AEZI5ES3LFYNSNHLSU3EN4T3SC6A,1,142,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
803,R1BHDNEFJ0AW20,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars SONY WH-1000XM4... BEST HEADPHONES EVER,moo,5,"I am coming from a set of Bose QC15 and Sony MDR-7506 and wow!! Hats off to Sony for their MKIV headphones.Sony WH-1000XM4 has incredible sound and features!The active noice cancelling works GREAT!!! I put my head next to the wall AC unit and can barely hear a thing.Compared to my QC15, the Sony is so much better at ANC you'd think the Bose were turned off. Don't get me wrong, I've loved my QC15 on a daily basis for over ten years but comparing these are like night and day.Music from Sony WH-1000XM4 sounds rich and full in a way that I've only heard at a movie theatre and the Bose QC15 and MDR-7506 are no schlubs; I'm used to decent headphones. The custom EQ that you can set and upload to the Sony WH-1000XM4 using their proprietary app is everything. Very intuitive and easy to use and you don't even NEED the app if you just want to use them out of the box and not futz with settings, it can pair like any normal bluetooth device by holding down the power button; however, the app does everything automatically.Compared to AirPods Pro, the ability to tune every feature versus just on/off makes me feel like I have a quality high-end device versus a kind of generic one. Not to get off topic, but I returned the AirPods Pro; they are nice but not for the money. I felt that AirPods Pro FUNCTIONED very very well (Good ANC, brilliant pairing, can use either left, or right, or both, and the auto on/off/pause/play works like a charm) but I thought that they missed the mark on sound quality, comfort, and battery life just enough that I didn't feel that they were worth $200+.Spoiler Alert, I went with Bose QC Earbuds but that's another story.Getting back on topic...The Sony WH-1000XM4 are worth every cent. I scored mine on Prime Day and got a great deal on them!!They're worth MSRP... but try for less. I got them for $75 off MSRP Oct 14, 2020 and they did free next day delivery.There's my obligatory plug, where's my gift card?Oh, right. It was in the box with my headphones, duh. lol. (they gave me a gift card for Prime Day)The thing that surprised me the MOST about the Sony WH-1000XM4 are how well they perform as a headset. Whatever gadgetry they've packed in these is pretty magical. When on a phone call or FaceTime, the headset WHILE KEEPING ANC ACTIVE, makes it so I can hear myself speak and therefore am not shouting while on the phone like I typically am. WHILE ANC IS STILL WORKING. Magical.The auto I/O/Play/Pause feature when you remove them from your head is very nice too.Very happy about multipoint bluetooth. I have it set to work with my iPhone and Sony X950H TV and it's seamless.I was actually waiting for them to upgrade to having this and is why I didn't go for the MKIII. Glad I waited.The case is nice and holds all of the accessories plus a few more tiny ones that I had for other travel things. The case fits perfectly in my laptop bag (Brenthaven Elliot Deluxe) and does not make it any bulkier or bulgy. The case is actually smaller than the one for my QC15 because the Sony WH-1000XM4 fold up! Bonus!!USB-C charging instead of Micro-USB is superb, I am very much enjoying the rapid charge feature and since I plan on having these for a long time, the port is a sturdy one that will take many many many plugging/unpluggings.Battery life seems to function as advertised, although I haven't timed it for 30 hours, I just charge it at the end of the night. If I forget to, no worries, it's charged enough for the day by the time I am done getting ready to go.All in all, very happy with the Sony WH-1000XM4.

804,R1Z8K8GMOUV106,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly a Worthy Successor to the WH1000xm3!,Bradley,5,"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.",10/15/2021,AFKIZZFUQDOWZ72ZQFX6UJBSPDCQ,1,152,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only
805,R8H3J5IAMVQYO,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars My review is effectively these should be xm 3.1 not 4 build but good otherwise.,s,5,"about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video. Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful. That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s. By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great. I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same. Get these. :)",09/14/2020,AH53ZBSOM7ZRSWR6RACMNAE32SZQ,1,14,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
806,R1U65T3UFWZLG4,B0863FR3S9,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product, Great Customer Service - Best Overall Headphones",Lio,5,"Customer Service: 5/5I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.Product: 5/5Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.",02/1/2021,AFPLI4FFCUNPV4VG7D7ZEEUI3OPQ,1,11,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
807,R3D4YJSFPEC0YM,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise cancelling, bluetooth range, sound very good, comfortable, horrible user controls",TechPicky,4,"A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program. While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review. Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make. A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones. The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent. This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available. The Bluetooth range is also exceptional. Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone. They have long battery life and charge quickly. They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful. There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush. However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.) If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses. They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously. The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time. I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones. I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app. I was then able to play music from the MacBook. I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something. It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky. Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch. Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device. Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where. This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35. I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device. It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device. Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2. The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app. This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices. It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices. You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device. You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected. You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent. It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another. The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent. For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones. Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable. Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response. More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep. You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight. The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies. Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified. Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment. These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment. High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences. I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones. They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier. That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth. The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth. I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones. They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing. The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound. Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good. Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet. This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS. You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it. You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play. I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better. To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature. This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content. I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music. It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better. At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies. It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable. This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used. The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal. I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup. I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic. There was some front/rear placement depth. It was interesting to play with for a while. What I found though is that it just sounded strange. I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical. Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable. It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above. Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks. Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical. By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations. With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls. They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with. Most people said I sounded fine. I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone. They said I sounded “far away.” On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19. This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation. I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35. At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call. My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these. I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these. I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring! Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music. I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane. Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice. They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls). These definitely exceed the rated battery life. With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use. I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge. Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable. On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic. It is more than enough though. It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use. Almost any other use it should be more than enough. I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector. They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply. They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it). You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging. I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity. They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power. In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick. It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones. The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable. Simple buttons would have been much better. Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing. You try and turn the volume down and track changes. To be fair, they do have a volume control. The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right. Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume. Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume. Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that. I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times. Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device. It will then want to pair with Bluetooth. I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt. If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app). You could just say Alexa and it worked. You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would. It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app. The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though. This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content. It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume. Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems. This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better. It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google). I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying. At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard. This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode. While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode. This mostly works. In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it. Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode. There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet. You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while. Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control. This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions. This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc. I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying. It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions. This can be disabled in the app. If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well. (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones. Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual. The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more. You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears. I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK. It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information. It shows battery level, and the current codec in use. This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details. Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35. It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system. The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling. It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.",10/11/2020,AE7DZ3XTVG6DTUFU2KBE52MDPL4A,1,576,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
808,R2RUMUO1GMQ7JX,B0863FR3S9,3.0 out of 5 stars Not everything I ever dreamed of...,Andrew Cousineau,3,"I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says ""Power on"". Then it tells you ""Bluetooth connected"" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says ""Bluetooth second device connected"". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... ""Ambient sound"" which sounds bad so I press the button again... ""Ambient Sound control off"". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.",06/4/2024,AHVIBRANSX6ITQCAF6SA5XNMQNAA,1,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
809,R17KWZY74P83HQ,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Very Solid For Out-of-Office,Jason Brannock,4,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.Microphone and PlaybackThe E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileBoth associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandJabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantThe E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleComfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesThere’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.",02/13/2021,AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,1,66,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
810,RJE80FBWZNCH6,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Mind blowing noise cancellation,Hugo Stiglitz,5,"The noise cancellation is insane. The first time i turned them on i couldnt believe it. I was used to pretty weak NC, and these are supposed to be the best. What a differenceOne thing i hadnt thought of is that noise cancellation actually does make a big difference to sound quality while previously i didnt think it was that important. But because it gives you an almost silent environment, everything sounds better.I also love that it has LDAC support. The transmission rate is automatic and unfortunately rarely uses the highest quality, but you can force it with developer options on any android phone (look up a guide to do that). The connection is perfect on the lower settings and you can go 100ft away from your phone and itll still work fine. Its only at the highest setting that theres any issues, but IMO its still worth using if you have high res audio files. Its near indistinguishable from the sound quality of a wired connection at the point (and assuming youre not in a totally silent envionment with NC off.TThe only weak point is the frequency response, but its also personal preference. Its balanced but bass heavy which a lot of people like. I don't. In my opinion it should be more neutral.When audio professionals mix and master music, they already put in as much bass as they can (in modern music) so there's no need for headphones to add even more. They know what theyre doing so it makes no sense to me to try and ""enhance"" what doesnt need to be ""enhanced""Unfortunately most consumers think more bass = better so headphone makers aren't afraid to add more than is necessary especially when other manufacturers add a ton, meaning if you don't as well people might say your product has weak bass, which isn't the case at all",06/29/2024,AF2WNSSZUVLPCMWGE7LNOXZTLGPQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
811,R709TK5SYB7PC,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly great,Whirlaway,4,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out. Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about). I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better. As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes. As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off. I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable. The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED: I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy. Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all). At other times, there are skips or pops. While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose. They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file. When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world. I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing. A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have. It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used. The ear pieces in particular are outstanding. I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable. However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable. These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on. I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well. I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either). The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music. Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue. I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file. I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it. It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason. For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh. Some calls are good, others not so much. Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality. However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc. Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better. I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on. However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.). It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones. However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have. I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.",09/24/2020,AGY3FKXCB7VCVYWXHL4MLDKIBUUQ,1,36,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
812,R2USDO6PGSXOSG,B0863FR3S9,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, good NC...multipoint Bluetooth FAIL!",John,2,"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II. I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later). The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II. However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II. Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy. With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great. A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality. The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi. Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback. However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling. It wasn't present with the XM3. I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4. I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely. The XM3 still has some leakage. The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better. The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for. The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once. FAIL! I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4. I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed. Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated. So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth. Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless. This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device. However, the way it manages connections is very poor. I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer. If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound. Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio. I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play. If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless. With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode. They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed. So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3. I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them. With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it. But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet. At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for. I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on. The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls. Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead. It's a small annoyance. On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking. Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it. If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on. Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated. Super slow and awkward and unusable. So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak. When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day. Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone. I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them. I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this. Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking. Nice in concept - terrible in practice. I just turned it off and left it off. If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time. So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening. What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying. So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone. With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot. It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching. The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable. I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great. Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones. This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones. How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use? It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product. If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it. The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3. Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering. The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3. In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark. I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones. As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back. Sadly, they are not as advertised.",09/19/2020,AFDEU4TPM7P7QRC7HKAXHD4O5L3Q,1,41,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
813,R1KYYRPR3VE2DG,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Get these...at the right price,H. Ricks,4,"I got these as a 2023 Christmas upgrade from the XB-900. I loved their sound quality (especially the bass of the XB-900), but it lacked conveniences that made it difficult to use those on a regular basis (being that I'm in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone/iPad/Mac and Apple TV). When they were around 30% off, it was a no-brainer.The ANC is still great. They may not be on the level of AirPods Max, but they're just as good as the XM-500's. The sound quality is more 'balanced,' so while you don't get massive bass (like the XB series, Skullcrusher or Sony Ult), they can keep up.But my favorite aspects, coming from the XB900's, are its ability to multi-pair between 2 devices. It was frustrating to have to go through a process just to switch devices. Granted, you have to use the app to enable them between devices, but that's still better than having to go into bluetooth settings and unpair, then re-pair.Also, I like the play/pause gesture feature that weren't on the XB900. While it wasn't that much of a biggie (be it tap the cup to pause or pause on the app or device), it felt more natural to just take them off for it to pause your media. And, unlike some of Apple's offerings, I like that you can create your own EQ settings than their stock settings.While it took some time to modify the settings for ANC/pass-through (based on work/home/travel environments), the experience when using is great.Overall...the XM-400's are as good as the newer 'flagship' XM500 (almost forgot: they fold better...be around your neck or case). You're getting great sound, great ANC, great battery life, decent build (albeit plastic) and great customization. But if you get these when on sale (especially around or under $230), you're getting a premium device at a 'Goldilocks' price!My 3 cents...",06/18/2024,AH34Y7RKTMJ47UGXWZPX25J3JMZQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
814,R28ULTR4EVN00O,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but be aware of quirks and limitations",T. Apuzzo,4,"UPDATE 11/11/20: With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.UPDATE 10/30/20: No update from Sony on the microphone issue. My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor. I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls. Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.Below is my ""evergreen"" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:Pros:+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices. The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into ""wind"" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.Cons:- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything. With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature insteadEqual:* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4Personal Preference:* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.* The ""silver"" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.",09/1/2020,AGNOHQRHY74UUQ6YUYPHD5MWD6JA,1,17,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

I use a nice pair of monitoring headphones for my music, a gorgeous pair of consumer headphones for relaxation listening, and I've owned many pairs of in-ear and over-the ear headphones through the years.

816,R38T61DMMWO74Q,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sony WH-1000XM4 vs. Bose 700 vs. Jabra Evolve2 65, mostly for Zoom meetings",Michael23,4,"I was looking for headphones for work and personal usage. I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:Bose 700Sony WH-1000XM4Jabra Evolve2 65Jabra 85HJabra Evolve 75And I ultimately ordered the top 3.Here's my review:Sony WH-1000XM4:- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphonesthough its microphone quality isn't great- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for himBose 700:- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not greatJabra Evolve2 65:- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with BluetoothSOME TAKEAWAYS:- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the pastDECISION:I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!",01/10/2021,AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ,1,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
817,R6SURW0X715LZ,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Noise Canceling is Amazing,KL03,5,"This was my first time using noise canceling headphones and I was amazed by how good the noise canceling was. I put them on while on an airplane and the tight fitting cups sealed around my ears, slightly reducing the noise of the plane. Then I turned on the noise canceling and everything went silent. I had no idea that noise canceling could work this well.I bought the XM4 over the newer XM5 because some reviews said they were better. Overall I'm very happy with them and I will be bringing them with me every time I travel on a plane.Pros:-Excellent noise canceling-Very good battery life. They last much longer than an ipad or phone when watching movies.-Can still be used as regular wired headphones if the battery dies, or if bluetooth isn't an option, like with an airplane screen. I should note that the noise canceling will still work when wired if the battery is good.-Nice small case for travelingCons:-They are kind of small for over the ear style headphones, so you probably won't like them if you have large ears.-Most of the controls aren't actual buttons, so it's hard to figure them out. I feel like I need to pull out the manual every time I want to use them.",05/21/2024,AH2TMNDROGMPVZDOWNBG6KOANSPA,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
818,R2MO9ZYPG1J4G4,B0863FR3S9,"5.0 out of 5 stars An Immersive Sonic Oasis: Sony WH-1000XM4, The Epitome of Wireless Premium Noise Canceling",RTW1979,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones are an absolute game-changer!

819,R1NL6NRC83D8N1,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Audiophile Perspective,A. Matthewson,4,"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).- Build quality is good for a headphone in this price bracket, given the tech.- Noise cancelling is honestly unbelievable, though please note these are my very first pair of NC headphones.- Decent sound for what it is, with good battery life to boot.- Cool intelligent tech, though admittedly I do not use it at all (I keep NC on at all times and do not utilize the speech recognition feature).- Mobility.- Truly some great tech thrown in here, and I can see the R&D going to work, also fairly useful app.Cons:- Price.- Sound quality is lacking when compared to setups at this price point (though I hear it is the best sound quality when comparing to other NC cans), however more on this below.- Ears can become warm after a while.- This may be just me, but I have issues with ear pressure changes throughout the day and can cause a feeling of needing to - and not being able to - ""pop"" my ears, which is annoying and causes long-term comfort to be an issue for long sessions, forcing me to switch back to my faithful 599's.To elaborate, I have HiFiman x Drop HE4XX'S, with a Schitt Modi/Magni stack DAC/AMP. This entire package cost me the same exact price as the MX4's from Sony, and the sound quality is essentially night and day difference. Sound stage, separation, and dynamic sound range is definitely noticeably worse on the MX4's, and there is significant bleed through the bass and mids in some songs. For reference I am listening on Tidal, with Master track quality. Even on my HE4XX's, the bass is tighter and more responsive, and, while not a bass-havy pair of cans, provides a much more accurate and tight listening experience across all ranges. This is partially due to the open back versus closed back design, but again for the price, if you do not care about being so mobile, or perhaps work from home or are a student doing much of your work and homework from a home office or fixed location like myself, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you travel all the time and absolutely cannot live without maximum portability and noise cancelling, then the MX4's are the way to go. The sound quality is adequate (though I still grit my teeth when considering how much these cost compared to my true audiophile headphone set ups given the sound quality), especially when compared to other closed-back designs, and again the NC is absolutely insane. Another point is that firmware updates will hopefully keep improving on the already impressive and interesting tech inside these cans.All in all, I really do like the MX4's, but due to the price, it makes me hard to recommend to someone who cares chiefly about sound quality first, and the convenience and portability/NC factors second. If this is the case, I'd say go to something with a better sound profile, and you will likely find yourself spending less with a better musical experience, and a recommendation off the top of my head would be the EXCELLENT Senheiser HD599's (around $200 new on Amazon). Personally, if they would have saved on some R&D and kept the voice and calling features to a minimum but dropped the price, this would be a no-brainer for everyone, but I digress. If however, you need the solid NC and are excited about the mobility and convenience and the versatility that these cans can bring, and are okay with the compromise on sound quality as well as the steep asking price, I would say you would be hard-pressed to go anywhere else than the MX4's. I am still debating on keeping these or not, as I have been spoiled with amazing sound experiences for the past 3-5 years now, and I find it hard to take a hit to my pocketbook like this when I could get a truly awe-inspiring pair of audiophile cans to use with my current setup for the same exact price, though the MX4's are good enough to make it a hard decision which is itself a promising sign.Tldr; Should you buy the MX4's? It depends, but I do like them, and you need to just consider your use case when making that decision. This is a lot of money to spend on a pair of headphones, and if sound quality plays a large part in your decision, you have some serious competition to look at. Would I say I recommend the MX4's in general? Yes.",08/26/2020,AEHBO45A5VT7QL4WOIMAXEQOW26Q,1,21,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
820,R32NKDVGVF2QPR,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great!,JWH,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great! Put on the headphones, turn on the power and it's like the aircraft engines have turned off - the low rumble is just gone. Entertainment doesn't have to be turned as loud in order to hear it clearly.The best thing about the Sony is that it can be used ""wired"" into airline entertainment, rather than having always to rely on finicky BlueTooth. The Sony comes with a two-prong adapter to fit the airlines two-prong plug holes, but the adapter isn't necessary (at least on United Airliness 787 aircraft). It appeared to me the two-prong aircraft sockets were made up of 3.5mm and a 2.5mm holes. (I didn't have a 2.5mm plug, so I can't swear to that.) The Sony jack was 3.5mm and it worked well plugging it into the other, 3.5mm, socket - complete stereo worked. From testing at home I'd say the wired configuration provides slightly better sound than through BlueTooth, also. Wired appears to provide better power usage, too; I used it on a 17-hour flight for three movies, I think, and arrived with the power level at 80% from starting at 90%.It does require a bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't expect a newbie like me to pull it out of the box for the first time while on the aircraft and expect it to be satisfying. This is my first ANC device in maybe 10 years and that first experience wasn't successful, so it took me awhile to try again. Basically, hold the power button for two seconds to turn it on, hold it for seven seconds to pair with BlueTooth. You can get by without the Sony headphones app, but without it you won't know the battery charge level or be able to change sound profiles; I want to hear dialog better, so I have bass present, but not overwhelmingly so. Interestingly, you can pair the headphones with two devices at the same time, while other ANC earbuds just switch fast between two different connections. Both appear to work okay and allow you to listen to your cellphone music or the aircraft entertainment. Sony has short little movies that walked me through headphone settings.That's a lot of ""pro,"" but there are a few ""cons."" Over-ear headsets are bulky and have to be carried in already stuffed carry-on luggage. Some people don't like the pressure of over-ear headsets on their ears. That's about it, though, and if you've bought them at all then these issues don't sneak up on you. I've had them for a month or so now so I can't speak to their sturdiness or long-term reliability, but they do appear to be sturdy and the case protects them.What would I like to see improved? Not much, for over-ear ANC headsets. If I could find a set of wired ANC earbuds I'd surely try them to cut down on the bulk, but they'd have to work very well to provide the same sense of isolation I get from over-ear headsets. As things are, this Sony is definitely a ""buy.""",12/30/2023,AEGS73DFBTN563YPSMA2EM2EEEAA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

831,R3LOW0OAVZVPNN,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling, everything else is ok",MyHonest2Cents,4,"In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a ""voice mode"" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.",05/20/2022,AGXVB4UEYOJCFXO6XR45I52IWWWQ,1,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
832,R1JKUN1J8FVF5H,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beast Headphones, solid Noise-cancelling/ beautiful sound/ Comfort.. But don't pay full price.",xnpate,4,"Last several months I've spent studying for MCAT, and as it neared the exam I needed more time away from distractions and due to the pandemic sneaking away to my local libraries wasn't an option as I could only be there for an hour or two tops, I needed NC headphones being at home. Typically anytime I saw anything NC the WH1000 series was the way to go, as advised by the tech world and audiophiles. I had found a good deal on Airpods Pro and during Prime Day Deals found these. I was shocked to find the latest Sony headphones discounted $50 and bundled with $25 Amazon GC as well. The reason I mention Airpods is because I personally have seen many comparisons. I'll break down as much as I can below, I don't consider myself an audiophile.Pros:When it comes to sound and listening to music with the Sonys hands-down best thing I've listened to and gives like new life to music. These are built really nicely and cushioned really well up top and around the ears. Oh man boy are they lightweight!. Some heat around my ears after using them for a bit, and they press on my glasses (but they're crappy glasses that I have problems with beforehand anyway) so they press in my ears/head.Battery: Lasts me several uses on one charge, meaning I can use them a good 4-5 days before wanting to charge them. Sometimes I can get a couple hours in and still not even lose 10% of battery life. (when compared to Airpods, no question Sonys better). When not used for a period of time they will automatically shut off so even better.Case: Nice holds your cords and headphones nicely. It's not a hard case though so I'd be careful shoving them into tight spaces against things.While i mentioned the cables... Sony needs to make the charging cable longer it's INCREDIBLY short.Cons:Touch controls: The lack of buttons to control Play/Pause, Volume, kind of sucks for me. At first it seems fun and intriguing. But over the course of using them, I find myself swiping and hearing the feedback that something is being activated but actually wont happen. There are moments when I'm stretching or resting my behind my head and arm knicks the touch control and pauses the music. And this is weird because the touchpad can be really sensitive like in that example, but other times wont register I'm trying to activate the controls. Volume should absolutely just be a wheel, pause/play skip features as touch I'd be okay with.Dual connection: I haven't had much use of this, at first I had my laptop and iPhone connected. Now Idk if my problem is due to my older computer with older Bluetooth, but my sound went silent on my headphones. I haven't connected them back to my laptop since. But I think ideally this would be great to be connected to your phone/computer and get notifications. There is a delay between activating playback from one device to the next.Mic: Friends have told me my voice sounds artificial with Sonys and prefer if I wear my Airpods to communicate if I want to use headphones.Noise-CancellingTo anyone who wants a comparison between Airpods Pro and these. If I hadn't had Airpods Pro right before purchasing these I'd have nothing poor to say about the Sony's NC. Airpods as they go in the ear already help with dulling sound before activating NC. The biggest issue I have in my house is the droning of my AC and Fans. Airpods make them disappear and sound like a light breeze or wind without all the mechanical droning from noise machinery. Sonys do a good job for those sounds for me, but not as well as the Airpods. HOWEVER, this is before any music or sound playing. Once you have something playing with the Sonys the world is gone and that's about half-ish volume. I find myself speaking louder at times not even being able to realize my brother is talking right next to me. I don't necessarily have the same effect with Airpods. And you don't have to worry about fit.ConnectivityI've heard that with Android getting the XM4 connected is quick, but even with iPhone it's simply connecting another Bluetooth device. (compared to airpods obviously the apple interface is as simple as opening your headphone case)AppPretty easy to follow interface, readily updates. If you like experimenting with equalizer settings then you'll have fun. I've heard people complain it being complicated, but without messing with anything except turning off a setting that pauses audio when talking. You can leave everything as is and really not need it after the initial setup and for updates.Final thoughts if you have the money I'd go for these they're wonderful, but I don't think these warrant the full price TBH. The touch controls can be finicky, but if you want quality sound/NC/Comfort/Fit this is it. Anyone seeing this right during the holidays with BlackFriday/Christmas/Cyberdeals whatever; I was shocked seeing these brand new Sonys discounted to the same price as the XM3 on Amazon, I'd look for these and nab them when discounted.",11/12/2020,AFY3JHUWWTAHBJZNBVXSOOORVGMQ,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
833,R2D8OVJ75Z7DSP,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars 1000 hr review,C Stribs,5,"Alright, So I have put alot of time into these 1000xm4s over the last three months. These headphones are fantastic! However it took me about 50-100 hours to get used to them. I'll explain. So I have owned cheap ""noise canceling"" TAO Tonic $40 black friday special wireless headphones and I had good wired $200 Sennheiser 599 open ear headphones. My previous experiences with headphones were to get the most out of the audio or to cancel out noise I needed to near max out sound volume and reach deafening thresholds. After listening to these headphones I started to realize I needed to change the way I was using these headphones. First of all the app is nice. You can adjust the EQ to custom or use a preset EQ setting. I chose to turn of the speak-to-chat as it would easily pick up my voice if I was singing along or making any loud adublie sound while working out. But getting back on track I found that I could listen to music, podcasts, Netflix ect at a very low level and hear everything perfectly. I was so use to staying at a 80-90 percent volume from my previous headphones that I was at little sad that the 80-90 level on this headset didn't sound as loud as my older headphones. Simply put these bad boys do such a great job noise canceling that you can clearly hear audio at very low levels. You may not feel alot of punchy bass with them (it's there though) you also won't hear any distortion even bumped to max levels. Also, these Sonys will automatically and continuously track your environment and adjust noise canceling and ambient sounds according to if your laying in bed or get up to a walk, or sitting a plane ect. They will also save you hearing as well but sadly not your bank account. If you plan to work out with them they will be a solid option. Again I haven't heard any distortion while working out or on a treadmill, bike, or rowing machine. Since they are closed ear style they may get warm on your head. I always get a q-tip out and swipe off the sweat condensation that accumulates inside the left ear cup on the plastic ear sensor after workouts (I dont know if this is recommended). I haven't had any issues with them slipping off my head either. The hand and swipe gestures take a little time to get used to but work well. Every now and then the swipe forward/backward and up/down to skip tracks or volume doesnt work but I feel this is user error on my part. The cover over the right headphone is a cool feature. It will easily flood ambient sound in allowing you to quickly and temporarily converse with someone or you could leave the speak to chat feature on. Additionally you receive a nice hard carrying case, charger brick, usb-C cable, and aux cord. I've used the aux cord quite a bit with my nintendo switch and it does a great job. Also the 1000xm4s are very forgiving if you forget to plug them in when runinng low on power. In 10mins I can quick charge them to last about10hours. I think the specs say 3 hours till 100% charge but I swear I had my headphones fully charged in about 1 hour. They are dual voltage which has been great for traveling abord. Lastly you can connect up to two Bluetooth devices which at time. Honestly I didn't think I would even need this feature. However I found out it is very convenient for seemlesly swapping devices or getting notifications from my phone/watch while connected to my laptop or when I'm bluetooth connected to my switch. So they are a great pair of headphones but you will take a hit to bank account. I picked up a open box Amazon return which knocked off over $100 on the price and the headphones came without any issues. If you see these on a decent sale I would scoop up a pair. Also if you want more of a punchy bass type headphones I would also recommend XBN-900N which I tested out shortly and you can tell they are more focused on bass bumping. I believe they are significantly cheaper new but don't have all of the same features.",01/12/2022,AH4Y52RTEYUMLCRPZVE3UJLJBNRQ,1,26,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
834,R3V7P534S1M992,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Not For Everyone?????,ohm,4,I've had the Sony WX4's for about a year now and I have overall really loved them but I don't think they are for me. The noise cancellation is amazing and the adaptive sound is cool and all but wearing them for a prolonged period does take a toll. Due to them not having holes in the ears very little air flow is noticed making your ears like a sauna. I've worn these to workout countless times and I can say that they don't feel comfortable at all when in high-intensity situations solely due to the zero air flow. Over all 7/10 product not for me.,06/23/2024,AHH6KLOQO76DQBYXKKUKM7W6EFEA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
835,R11GP1556DW75I,B0863FR3S9,"5.0 out of 5 stars Beyond anything I could have imagined...if noise distracts, buy back your productivity!",Mike,5,"I have used active noise canceling technology in protective ear muffs, and I have had some ear buds that were passive noise canceling, so I kind of thought I had an idea what these where going to be like. Nothing could prepare me for my first impression, and we’ll every subsequent impression.My wife does telemedicine from home, and soon we plan to add another dedicated office, but for right now we share a room. The distraction of having a constant conversation in the background has driven me to feel like a nomad - wandering from flat spot to flat spot. The laptop isn’t an issue, but the scanner, 32” monitor, keyboard, keypad, paperwork,etc...well you get the point. So I found a 17” led up in the attic...no go, for the record don’t ever get used to one size monitor than essentially try to get use to one 1/4th that size. I tried listening to music with my passive ear buds, finally I used my protective muffs that I have for mowing, shooting, anything loud and it sort of worked but those try to defeat harmful noise levels. I tried wearing earbuds playing music underneath the muffs and while that worked, my ears however felt like they had been in a vice.Well that leads me to these, while these are more costly than anything I ever have purchased for audio - other than my home theater equipment. Let me say now I’m case I am being wordy, these are worth every penny.I can be attached to both my iPhone and laptop, so I can get feedback from my computer or listen to audio and still here when I get an alert on my phone. When I wish, the head phones do not require any actual music or anything. I literally feel like I am alone in a “cone of silence” for those familiar with the old Get Smart episodes. If my wife or any other family member needs me it is easier to text me than to call out to me. While that is a little inconvenient, my ability to concentrate has increased multi-fold which has also allowed my productivity to feeling a pure joy rather than the stress of always feeling like you need to do more.These are also light, and have no issue navigating by size 8 head. The app setup for these is wild. I have done moldable ear plugs, but I never dreamed I would take a selfie and then snap shots of each ear to customize the sound. The other fascinating thing happened completely by accident, I was listening to a presentation online but needed to work on dinner. I thought I paused the pc and joined on the phone. But evidently I never stopped the pc and hearing audio I didn’t worry about anything. Well I realized that my pc was communicating with the Sony app and the app was evidently acting like a radio repeater...I was out of range of my office but set my phone out of the way where it won’t get wet, dropped or anything else. It was only when I tried to stop the presentation did I realize what had occurred. I now use this all the time and have subsequently learned to pause/play with the controls. Lastly, and this will completely give away the secret that I never read instructions...I could not figure out how to connect a phone call. I used the buttons like I do on my other Bluetooth earbuds, but that didn’t work. I felt stupid when I learned all that I had to do was tap the center of the right muff.I know this is a lot of money, and While it is rare for productivity be literally monetized unless you are on commission, I can tell you that these allow for peace in total chaos...oh, if I had these 20 years ago when our second child was colicky🙂.I normally buy black by default, grey if black isn’t available, but my wife encouraged me to try the blue. While I am color blind, I still see color, amd like the blue...my wife also likes the color which is way more important. I am starting to sense that I will be buying another pair of these for my wife because when she is charting on her EMR distractions are awful.",03/15/2021,AGR7CTQV4ETCIWAPZDP42W5V6EQA,1,3,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only
836,R3JI08GCH5LUUQ,B0863FR3S9,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but several issues make it a no-go for me. Sticking with my Bose QC 35 Series I",Dennis,2,"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them.",08/21/2020,AFERWW2A4UHMJIFE23HMMIJL2SXA,1,1914,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
837,R1JJLGFUZ7LMKT,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I've ever owned but -1 star for several minor usability issues,Tayne,4,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy. The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals. I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally. Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy. Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time. In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLYOne of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKSIt seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)Again, best headphones I've ever owned, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But the minor issues I describe above, combined with the high cost of these things, were enough to knock a star off my rating. Buyer beware :)",08/23/2020,AGEKBKA2Z63J7U3URXIPCFNZQOGQ,1,379,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

First time with fancy headphones so I cant really compare to others, but they sound amazing and are pretty comfortable. I can usually go 3ish hours before I have to take a break comfort wise. The battery is fantastic (only indicates in 10% increments), and probably gets about 12-15 hours before it hits 50%. The noise canceling is very nice too, and you can put your hand over the side of it which is great to hear random conversations without taking them off, albeit you look pretty dumb. I’ve been too afraid to work out with them because it says they arent waterproof/resistant, so no input on that aspect.

841,R24CNHZWHJRWOV,B0863FR3S9,"3.0 out of 5 stars GREAT for Music -- BAD for Calls, Teams, etc",David Diskin,3,"Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.",08/31/2022,AFYFHYV5S7I7LYF7JRA63MPQGDTA,1,29,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
842,R2JMIRC62ED8BT,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Saying Goodbye to Bose...,Kaladin Stormblessed,4,"I've been pro-Bose for YEARS (QC35's being the most recent headphones). Not necessarily for the booming bass/audio quality, but for the convenience factor (on the go, on the plane, zoom meetings, etc...), excellent battery life + amazing noise cancellation. To balance, I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (though oddly designed), sound great both via Bluetooth or cabled/analog via a DragonFly, playing FLAC, etc...Well..., my QC35's encountered the infamous always-on ""feature."" Flipping the button to off will give you an audible beep that it's being powered off, only to find that you missed 20 calls in your log that you never heard ring. If you're under warranty, you're golden (they'll offer to fix or a discounted upgrade). If not, you're forced to operate with miniature tools under a magnifying glass to bend the button contact points to maintain constant connectivity to the board. My QC35's were months out of warranty & I was SOL... Hacked per all the DIY vids which worked well for about 6 months. Earlier this week, however, I noticed several missed calls + the Bluetooth connection active. Sure enough, the Bose were ""back at it again..."" Didn't feel like hacking for another 6 month band-aid, so seriously considered picking up a pair of 700's. My coworkers, however, (the same ones who all originally had/suggested Bose), said they switched to Sony months ago... After researching pros & cons/side-by-side comparisons, the WH-1000XM4's seemed more & more a worthy competitor/option...Go-To Amazon of course had the WH-1000XM4's in-stock (& $60 cheaper than the Bose!), so ordered without hesitation. Headphones arrived (packaging & product) looking very slick (nice touch w/ the rose gold accents on black. Charged for about 30 minutes, then tested audio & call quality... BLOWN AWAY... Streaming music, movies, etc... seemed lightyears beyond what I subjected myself to w/ the Bose. My QC35's sounded flat & bass was non-existent. These headphones feel like I'm back in the mid 90's, cruising in my lowered Accord on wire wheels, bumping my Cerwin Vegas powered from an M100 Phoenix Gold Amp w/ Boston Acoustic pro series highs/mids. Yes, ""slight"" exaggeration (anyone w/ 12"" Vega's know what I'm talking about), but it DID take me back... Beyond impressed... No issues w/ audio quality as well on my Zoom's or direct bt to my phone.So..., audio quality is OUTSTANDING... What caught me off guard, however, was the noise cancellation! I thought Bose was amazing, but Sony's latest technology is on another level. It works so well, it's scary... Damn near can't hear a thing when they're on. Without any audio at all, it's as if you're trapped in ""soundproof vacuum purgatory,"" with nothing but you & your now blaringly loud tinnitus to keep you company. When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, you (to be continued: Apparently, my family has been calling my name for the last 10 minutes. They gave up & sent my youngest upstairs to physically wave her hands in front of me @ my workstation to tell me we're eating soon. Yes, the noise cancellation is THAT good). Ok, continuing where I left off above: When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, your ears are now hyper-sensitive to every day sounds. Birds chirping, humming of video equipment, the heater, etc... I always assumed that Bose was the leader in this technology, but Sony just knocked it out of the park...As far as cons? Very minimal & more of annoyances if anything... I use mine strictly for voice & audio (though I did install the app), so not really taking advantage of any of the advanced features. The Bose has a massive R & L inside the padding + the on/off switch is an easy queue as to which side is R or L. The Bose padding at the top of your head also appears to be a bit firmer/more comfortable. With the Sony, the buttons are camouflaged into speakers & the R & L are tiny (but color coded) markers on the inner headset. Marking is tiny, but as long as you associated Red with Right, then you're golden. Also, after a prolonged period of time, the very top of my head was throbbing/sore. I'd have to raise the headset slightly to give the to of my skull a break. Again, these are merely minor annoyances & the pros far outweigh the cons...Can't really say much more & for those TLDR, Sony's WH-1000XM4 put my Bose QC35's to shame (voice, audio & outstanding noise cancellation). Not sure how long these suckers will last, but assuming they stand the test of time, I don't see any reason why I'd ever return to Bose...",12/21/2020,AEYBZLL2AJCLTZWVTP6LC5TMDDBA,1,21,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
843,R3D37IETBXFZQP,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bluetooth Headphones I've had so far...,Daniel Meadows,5,"I have purchased and used a variety of wireless, over-ear style headphones over the years, but the Sony WH-1000XM4 (XM4's from here on), have provided a great experience so far! For simplicity's sake, I will only directly mention the other Sony pair I currently own, the XB900N.Note:This review is after one full (out of the box) charge. They lasted almost exactly three days after fairly heavy use. Material used during this period varied from heavy rock to classical, audiobooks, and videos from YouTube. Sections in the review are in CAPS for organization, not emphasis.The Positive:+ SOUND is phenomenal on these. Out of the box, they were almost on par with other sets I had set equalizer preferences for. Once the equalizer profiles were created for the XM4's, the music started sounding better than it ever has before through Bluetooth. These clearly favor a warm sound, and shine best when paired with bass heavy tracks, but all of my library has gotten some noticeable benefit from the XM4's.Sound is different for everyone, but these seem better out of the box than most I've tried, and custom profiles are easy to create with the Sony app.+ CONNECTIVITY was extremely easy. I had already installed the Sony companion app for headphones from the XB pair I had used before. I have not had any dropped connections so far.+ BUILD QUALITY feels like a pretty big step up from the XB900N's. Sturdy cans and a very soft headband are a nice combination. I've only had the XM4's for three days but I feel they will hold up fairly well. Considering I've had the XB pair for over a year with no noticeable degradation, I have high expectations here. The XM4's come with a great travel case too.The Neutral (still positive to me):1. CHARGING CORD is short. I like it because it is now the easiest charging cord to identify out of all the ones I currently use. The cord it is packaged with limits flexibility for charging locations, but is also perfectly functional for my needs.2. ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) function is good, almost too good. I have used these headphones a lot since I received them three days ago, and the first thing I noticed when I put them on- the ANC was overwhelming. I became somewhat queasy as soon as I turned them on. Once I opened the app I noticed there was a calibration tool for ANC. Once I went through that process, I no longer felt discomfort when using this feature. YMMV, but these block out most noise in my home, to the point it's just music or the book I'm listening to. I'm still getting used to how strong the ANC actually is.3. BATTERY LIFE was pretty good, but may have been somewhat under 100% out of the box, despite the headphones declaring a full charge when activated. I did not time my usage, but I probably got around 18 to 20 hours on the initial charge. Some settings for music quality and DSEE (sound enhancement for some content) will lower battery life according to Sony's companion app. It advised against using my settings for the best battery life experience. I appreciated but also ignored this advice. I know I won't be getting the full battery life from it, but it sounds so good! I'm leaving this detail under neutral to see if I get the same- or better - performance from a true 100% charge. Edit: lasted about the same, maybe one additional hour. Still good for daily, heavy use.4. TOUCH CONTROLS are a big debate among users of Bluetooth headphones. I happen to like how responsive these are, but I've also really liked some other headphones out there that had good old fashioned dials and buttons. I don't know which I prefer over the other, but the touch controls for the XM4's are not bad.The Negatives:- These get pretty warm. Ultimately, it isn't an issue to me because I wear glasses and they are still comfortable, just warm after longer sessions.Overall:The best Bluetooth headphones I've come across! Definitely worth the price on sale. The XM4's do not disappoint and provide truly top-tier ANC functionality. My new favorite headphones for music and audiobooks on the go.Thank you for reading my review!Hopefully the XM4's are finished recharging by now.Have a great day!",10/26/2021,AFXQD236J4IAIPMMDUVPGYEZ6PNA,1,43,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Before buying the Sony WH1000XM4, I had never ventured over the $200.00 mark. As far as wireless goes, I was fairly happy with the two IEMs and one headphone set from Soundcore. Mainly because of their outstanding app that let you tailor sound. When I saw the WH1000XM4s at $240.00 I was curious. There was no way I could stretch my budget for the XM5s.It took a lot for me to stretch for the $240.00. I'm happy to report that I did not waste my money. The noise control is effective to the point that I don't have to blast the headphones in the presence of heavy traffic. Why don't other companies reduce the price of their Hyped product when they are replace by newer models so that us people who are on strict budget can get a taste of the ""good life"".These headphones sound so good right out of the box, that I have yet to experiment with the app equalizer to change anything.

846,R1QCC0WCTVPPPJ,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable and Quiet,EliteTek IT,4,"Scroll to the bottom for pros and cons!The amazing sound produced by these Headphones can only be matched by the perfection of the ACN(Active Noise Canceling). With dynamic control from an app on your device to to the touch controls on the earpiece, ease of use is definitely a bonus feature. Sony spared no expense in attempting to build a lightweight comfortable headset and they succeeded.I purchased these headphones for a couple different reasons. First and foremost was for a long international flight I was preparing to take, and second was for a gym alternative to my AirPods. Though I have nothing against the AirPods, I was tired of sticking things in my sweaty ears.The first thing I noticed about these Sony headphones was the Dolby Atmos surround sound clarity. I first tested them in my home with my laptop making sure the Bluetooth connection was solid and clean. I was amazed at the dynamic range of sound and the realistic sound placement while watching high action scenes. I literally felt like I could look around and see the gunmen.The second thing I noticed was the amazing quality of the ACN which can be adjusted for sound pass through in the app. While walking through the airport, my phone lost signal for a moment and i immediately feared the headphones were the issue. As I removed them from my ears I was shocked at how loud the airport was. People talking, jets whirring up to taxi, the voice over the PA had been completely shut out. I put them back on my ears again and took them off several times marveling at the difference. Now that my childlike wonder was satisfied and it was time to board my plane.While waiting for taxi I listened to the cabin taking in all sounds and soon found myself dying to drown out the noise again. I set the pass through to about half sensitivity and put them back on. After some adjustment in the app I was able to find a perfect balance of cabin announcements and my music (Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, Morgan Whalen for reference).Ultimately over the course of the next 24 hours these headphones never left my head. I only needed to place them on to the charger after landing at the destination. Yes I was awake the whole time attempting to counteract jet lag. Conversely on the return trip I used nothing but the ACN to drown out noise and I slept comfortably(as you can on a plane) with them on the whole way home. These headphones completely stopped the drone of the engines and made for an enjoyable listening experience.The only thing that has disappointed me regarding my Sony Headphones is their functionality during active gym sessions. Though they were not excessively hot, sweat tended to make the earpieces very slick. They would slide around and even off while lying in horizontal positions such as bench press or push ups. In both sessions I wore these I found myself paying way more attention to trying to find a way to stop the slipping that I eventually took them off midway through the second session due to annoyance.Overall for lightly active people(walkers, hikers, traveling by car plane train) these headphones are a great sound at a great value. My only reason for a 4 star rating is the inability to use them functionally in the gym. (Yes I know there is nothing that claims these are for active wear)Pros:-comfort-lightweight-great battery life-ACN works wonderfully-Amazing Bluetooth range-convenient folding design makes storage easyCons:- not meant for active individuals that sweat.",07/1/2023,AFDGGVDZE73UGIVTZLZNANPP7NDA,1,15,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
847,R161CZ0PS65QJQ,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones! The best!!!!!,Janel MH,5,"So let's get the cons out of the way: pricey, but worth it!If hooking up Bluetooth headphones through a Bluetooth transmitter (for me I use one for my tv that doesn’t have Bluetooth), have to not download headphone app and make sure your phone doesn’t hook up to it via phone Bluetooth and you need to “forget this device” on your phone.For me I am not going to use these with my iPhone, so I deleted the app and did as above so my phone wouldn’t detect it, otherwise it’s hard to get it to connect to the transmitter. I don’t need the app that Sony suggests to download anyway because that is just for ambient and sound control/extras. More convenient if you do use headphones with your phone.Any more cons? I can think of any!Pros: a lot! I love these. I previously purchased cheap Bluetooth headphones from Amazon but wish I have got these sooner. The cheaper ones are ok but the ear pads hurt my ears after wearing them after an hour or two.I’ve only used these Sony headphones a couple times but after an hour my ears don’t hurt! The earpads are comfortable and fit over my ears well.As I said before, it’s easy to connect via Bluetooth transmitter(or whatever blue tooth you are hiking up to) after I deleted the app, if I want to watch tv.It’s hard to tell in the instructions with no words(I guess a con) but I looked it up in you tube, and while the headphones are on, press and hold (the on/off button)until the voice lady says Bluetooth pairing. This is a good tip because I didn’t get that right away. And then it connected!Was easy to reconnect as well using it another day.I can also listen to my tv and have the noise cancelling on and the same time! It’s great! I don’t even hear any traffic from outside or if someone has their subwoofer on in their car! It’s a game changer and a life saver.The noise cancelling is great in general also. And can be turned off if needed by pressing the button over the on/off button. Can also be switched to ambient sound.Overall these are the best headphones I’ve had. And totally forgot how good Sony was. I know back in the day I had a Walkman and cd Walkman and they were the bras knees. The Sony brand has always been good. They are still the best for electronics in my opinion.Another con I just thought of is the changes cord could be longer.Pro: comes with a nice fabric case and plug if if you want it wired an adapter for airplanes, etc.",12/15/2023,AGMSTFZ2H4KOB6D42AJN6YH7U6FA,1,9,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

850,R3V25GSVN3M9AR,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: Excellent sound & Comfort, Subpar Ergonomics, Auto-Shut Off Does Not Work as Expected",Richard N. Barg,4,"Note: this review is substantially changed. I forgot to proofed the initial review.I also own a pair of Bose QC 35s. The XM4s are definitely more comfortable and easier to wear for a longer period of time. They have less clamping and carbon pressure than the QC 35s, which really surprised me. I owned the XM-3s briefly before returning them. The XM4s, in my view, are considerably more comfortable, especially the headband which no longer exerts a downward force. The QC-35s, still being sold, seem ancient. I have also tried the somewhat polarizing Bose 700s. I’m not a fan, but concede, for phone calls, they are revolutionary in the way they use microphones to produce a clear sound even in noisy environments.The DSEE Extreme audio enhancement option does wonders for the sound, especially on audiobooks and podcasts. The rest of the app is spartan and lackluster.The XM4s device pairs very well with Bluetooth (BT) devices such as my iPhone and iPad, now simultaneously although you do lose the ability to use certain Codecs. BT on the XMS blow away the QC 35s in terms of initially connectivity, notably speed, have superior distance/range and duration of Bluetooth signal. Dropouts even next to the microwave oven, are minimal. The ability to connect two devices simultaneously to BT is a game-changer and a massive upgrade from the XM3s.The chat to talk function is useless and annoying and easy to accidentally turn on.The XM4 ssuffer from a lack of dedicated volume control dials. Car manufacturers removed this feature on their Infotainment system, notably Honda, and customers rightly pushed back. And now the volume controls dials are back. The Bose QC-35s, whatever it other shortcomings and dated design, have dedicated rocker switches that are far superior to the touchpad on the XM4s. Among other things they don’t beep when you raise or lower the volume. That beep is annoying and interferes with what you were listening to.In windy or rainy condition, the touchpad is unreliable, often activated by gusts and raindrops with unexpected results. With inclement weather and outdoors, I fall back to my trusty QC-35s.The touchpad suffers from another vice. You can easily invoke fast forward or rewind instead of the touchpad volume controls if your finger lands in the wrong place, which happens periodically by the law of averages. If you are an older adult whose hand motor skills have declined, have tremor, or Parkinson’s, by all means disable the touchpad. I find it somewhat difficult to easily orient the headphones, that is to quickly glean which is the left for the right ear cup when putting them on. Sony could have done a better job with a more conspicuous visual indicator.The phone call experience on the XM4s is superior to the Bose Q3-35s, but substantially inferior to the Bose 700s which blow away all the competition (Full disclosure - have not tested Apple’s new headphones). The active noise canceling on the XM4s seem superior to the Bose QC35s. The use of USB-C to charge the headphones is a vast improvement on Micro-USB.Sony has been, at a minimum, disingenuous, and arguably actively misleading the consumer in representing that the XM4s have auto-shut-off when that feature is enabled. In fact, auto-shut-off ONLY disables the noise canceling feature, which saves battery life, but does NOT turn off but the headphones. If you don’t remember to manually turn them off, you will invariably be greeted at some point with an inopportune “low battery” warning. Sony can and should do better. There is no reason the feature cannot work as represented.The Bose QC 35s, by contrast have a well-implemented auto-shut-off. And its very quick to manually turn them off with a rocker switch. With the XM4s, you have to hold down a button for an interminable 2-3 seconds. I simply plug in my XM4s to USB-C every night to ensure I have a charged set of headphones, How this will affect the battery life long-term is unknown.The XM4 case works, but is a bit weird. You have to do through numerous contortions to fold the headphones in such a way that they fit in the case. The cutout guides are so some helps, but overall the case on the QC-35s is simpler and allows for quickly storing them. The zipper on the Sony XM4s is of an inferior quality and often hangs, requiring you back up the zipper forward progress and start again.Thus I heartily recommend the XM4s, but with some reservations.",05/9/2021,AHCZHHNMP4MTYNJLGUE4UHGPLLBA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

I like that there is a sensor in the ear cup to pause your content, and via the app you can have it automatically transmit conversations. Though I found it a little too sensitive and annoying.I would recommend the app for EQ adjustment and function adjustments. I dislike it has a name which doesn't correlate in my mind, and I always forget what it is called.The headphones sound good, they are great for audio books, and musical, just not my favorite to listening to music. They have a good level of detail, but they seem to be balanced more for mid-range tones.The noise cancelation is OK, it makes annoying sounds a little dimmer, but like most, it sounds like a hollow, more tolerable tone of the noise.",04/20/2024,AFZGTBBAM6FJDZ272EWAEO4WOSLQ,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
854,R2V6FCX5P6469V,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Good Headphones,Amazon Customer,5,"These headphones have very good sound quality and feel well made. They arrived in nice packaging, and the carrying case they come with is decently compact and also good quality. I've had them for 1.5 years now, and after daily, extensive use, they are still doing fine. I may have to replace the ear pads in the next year, but that's an easy process and only around $20 for replacement parts. I got these on sale, and I recommend anyone interested wait for a prime or sale day for them to go on sale for like $200. They charge very quickly and last me a good couple days of all-day use on a full charge, even after 1.5 years. I'm not one to go into the equalizer and change stuff, so the basic sound settings sound great to me. The noise cancelling is good on transit and in the office. On transit or airplanes, it's also nice that you can hold your hand to the right ear, and it will enhance any announcements while quieting the music, so you don't have to actually remove the headphones. Noise cancelling in general doesn't do much for talking sounds, but the ear pads cup the ear and head nicely so you can't hear talking much either.One thing I wish they could change is the feedback beep the headphones make whenever you interact with the touch pad on the right ear. I get some people might appreciate it, but I spent a while when I first got the headphones trying to figure out how to turn it off. I got used to it after a month or so, but I had hoped for a bit more customizability. Tap to pause, a quiet beep, tap to play, another beep.

The fit is adjust so you can adjust it to your head.",05/8/2024,AHKU6RRYL4IDNFJON55YNXBRRW4Q,1,0,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only
859,R2NRCSDUHP4IOM,B0863FR3S9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound and Comfort, But Some Reliability Issues",Christopher J. Giannelli,4,"I recently purchased my second pair of these noise-canceling headphones, and I've had enough time to thoroughly evaluate their performance. Here's my take on them:Pros:Comfort: They're incredibly comfortable, even during long listening sessions.Appearance: The black design is sleek and aesthetically pleasing.Build Quality: These headphones feel high quality and durable, built to last.Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is nothing short of spectacular. It effectively blocks out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.Multi-Device Connectivity: Being able to connect to two devices simultaneously is a game-changer. It's a convenience that sets these headphones apart from others I've owned.Sound Quality: The audio and music sound quality is exceptional, with rich bass and clear treble that make for an awesome listening experience.Cons:High-Pitched Squealing: My first pair occasionally emitted a high-pitched squealing noise. It was so severe that I had to power them off. Unfortunately, the issue sometimes persisted even after turning them back on, leading me to purchase a second pair.Connectivity Issues: After about a year, my new pair began to experience connectivity problems, suddenly stopping audio playback. The only workaround is to power them off and back on, which is quite frustrating and happens all too often.Not ideal for working out: When doing horizontal exercises, like push ups, bench press, rows, etc. these tend to fall off because of the weight. If you're upright however, these are great. Although I'm not sure how the sweat effects them over time, hopefully that won't damage them?Overall:Despite the drawbacks, I genuinely love these headphones. They offer superior comfort, sound quality, and the unique ability to connect to two devices at once. However, I've encountered reliability issues with both pairs I've owned, from the distressing squealing noise in the first pair to connectivity problems in the second. While I would still recommend them for their outstanding features and performance, I do hope the manufacturer addresses these reliability issues in future models.",02/15/2024,AFFMUCTTNHASAJ3W3YURACQ4ALUA,1,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

862,R2SUXCOAV9YSTQ,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones with minor complaints,Joe k,4,"So I am coming from the Bose QC II, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So that will be the headphones ill compare these to. In terms of sound quality they are pretty neck and neck in this category, but I will give the slight advantage to the Sony headphones because they have an EQ on the app. The Bose headphones I felt had better highs, whereas the Sony headphones have much better lows. the mids really are not that much different in my opinion, although I'm not the best judge because I've only ever really used Beyerdynamics dt770s, so I'm not an audiophile by any means.If you listen to hiphop most of the time like I do, these headphones are great and much preferred over the Bose because of a significantly more punchy bass, like seriously, the Bose hardly have bass. However it isn't just hiphop, I also listen to electronic and a lot of fantasy music, like movie and game soundtracks. And these are fantastic for both.Next I will talk about comfort, this is one of the things I dislike about the Sony headphones, but also, this is entirely preference and head shape dependent. I noticed with the Sony headphones the top part of the headphone will hurt the top of my head in a much shorter time than the Bose headphones. Also the ear cups aren't the most comfortable, as I can feel my ears pressed up against the inside of the cups. In my opinion the Bose headphones are more comfortable here, especially over longer periods of time(I wear these headphones at least 6 hours everyday) But that's not to say the Sony headphones are not comfortable, they are very comfortable, more comfortable than my Beyerdynamic dt770 to be honest. They are just not as good as the Bose QC II's, but both are fantastic in this department. I'm not saying the Sony headphones are uncomfortable, I'm just saying they are more uncomfortable than the Bose headphones in my opinion.Next is design and color. So I really really like the color on the Sony headphones, the greyish looks so clean, and id be lying if I said that was not part of the reason why I switched. In terms of looks I love the Sony headphones way more. They just appeal to me more than the more egg shape Bose QC II's. Also the weight of the headphones is about the same, I think maybe the QC II's were slightly lighter, but its not an issue by any means, they are both really light.One of the things I hate most about the Sony headphones is the touch functionality, its a nuisance, to say the least. To the point where I actively try to avoid using the touch functions, like volume up, down, next song, previous, pause, etc. This is a prime example of putting unnecessary tech functions on a product, sort of like how they put tablets on a fridge now--like why? I way prefer the physical buttons on the QC II's. But I always wear an apple watch, and always have my phone on me so its pretty easy for me to change volume and songs on my watch/phone. But still, on the Bose headphones, I used the physical buttons all the time.A lot of times I will accidently pause the song by readjusting the headphones(readjusting needs to happen semi-frequently when wearing them at the gym), also if I try to use the touch controls --because for some reason I always think maybe this time it will be different. It usually ends up with me accidently swiping forward instead of up which will change the song. It is incredibly frustrating.Battery life is next, and Sony wins by 10 hours here, these are insane. 30 hours is great battery life, and it charges with USB-C rather than the older usb ports on the bose. No complaints here.Honestly, Its sort of hard to give these 4 stars, because they really are incredible, but I think because of the incredibly frustrating touch functionality, and the slightly uncomfortable ear cups I have to dock a star, if I could dock half I probably would, 4.5 is a pretty accurate rating, I would give these a 5 stars if they just removed the touch controls, and fixed the earcups somehow.",04/22/2021,AFVRXTQ5UZV3R4X6CIHDRIC676HQ,1,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

868,R2L92WEGWE2NY8,B0863FR3S9,"5.0 out of 5 stars Expected them to be great, and they exceeded my expectations.",Marcus,5,"Firstly, the first and finish of these headphones is very well done. They fit snug and comfortable on my head, while wearing my glasses or even a baseball cap.The audio quality for something wireless was surprising, and when paired with LDAC codec on an Android device (I've got a Samsung ZFold 5) you can expect a fulfilling wireless headphone experience. Needless to say, they are still non-comparable with a wired, audiophile grade headphone. I use DT-990s paired to a Soundblaster X G6 at my PC for context. Definitely do not expect that kind of performance.The Sony Headphones app is great and allows for a customized EQ and presets, atmospheric pressure for ANC, speak features, etc. App is easy to use and offers some greatly appreciated features for most if not all users.In conclusion, I feel like they're a great purchase - especially if you can catch them on a sale. I've got no complaints and feel like the value for product is more than worth it for these headphones even at MSRP.Lastly, I do not recommend these for an Apple product user, as you will not be able to take advantage of the LDAC audio codec, which increases audio quality with these headphones significantly! Unfortunately, Apple has not made an effort to include this codec in their audio compatibility.",03/22/2024,AFPPLK7P4OSS3OG2PWMMB25VB6YA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
869,R38VMTNJZ250QD,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars A Huge Treat Worth the Money,Savvy Consumer,5,"I've never owned high quality headphones, but when I started an office job after leaving teaching, I knew I wanted something good for conferencing on the phone and for listening to music as I worked. Also, I would use then on the airplane as full headsets are more comfortable than earbuds for me. I was moving into a new career and decided I deserved a treat.Features I love...1) Hold one hand over the right ear when noise cancellation is on, and it will deactivate for when you have to talk to someone in the room briefly. Take your hand away, and noise cancelling resumes.2) Music stops playing / pauses when you remove them and resumes when you put them back on (as long as it isn't too long. They do shut off automatically after a certain amount of time)3) I can be hooked up to my phone and computer at the same time4) Ambient sound mode really magnifies the sound around you, which is sometimes very beneficial5) Very comfortable on the head6) Swiveling ear pieces that fold in. This is why I went with the 4 and not the 57) Noise cancellation. I've tried other high end headphones, and these are just as good if not better.8) Control different options by making different types of swipes or taps on the ear pieces.For my first pair of high tech headphones, I am extremely pleased. I got them at a decent price on a sale day. It was a big treat for getting this new job, and I'm so glad I did it.",01/15/2024,AHY5BUCBVTDVO3TDY37N6GES4XBA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

871,R3SXVEP7ZDKCSF,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars My Take,Amazon Customer,4,"The Sony WH-1000XM4’s is a comfortable pair of headphones, designed for comfort, convenience, and to provide a whole new hearing experience with music and audio. Its base focus is ergonomic meaning it has adjustable bands, a comfortable padding, and smart controls that you can customize to suit your preferences. In March 2021, I was searching for a new pair of headphones for my birthday and this happened to come up. At that time it was priced around $300 but I did some further research and thought that these headphones would be a good investment because for one; I like to listen to music and two; I loved the features.Some of the strong aspects of the Sony WH-1000XM4 include the smart features, the app, customizable controls, battery life, and an ergonomic design for comfort. The smart controls can also be connected with the Sony Headphones App and it can also connect up to two devices at once. There is also a speak-to-chat function meaning that if you are wearing the headphones with music on and you start to talk to someone, it will automatically pause the music for you. Once you stop talking, it will resume the music. Besides this, it also has an ambience, normal, and noise-cancelling mode. It can be switched with the side button. Another one of its strengths is that these headphones have the ability to read the environment. When I used to ride my bike to the park while listening to music, they would switch to ambience mode for me to hear the cars and the music would be on low. As for the customizable controls, you can control the sound elements that you want either to be higher or lower within the app to maximize your listening experience. They also have some presets available but I usually stick with the ones I customize. I used them almost everyday and these are the most comfortable headphones so far. The hold is not too tight or loose. They also have Google Assistant and Alexa Built-In. But my most favorite part about these headphones is that I can change the track, change the volume, or make calls with just a tap or swipe on the right ear. The paddings are comfortable. The battery life on these are 30 hours and just charging for 10 minutes will give you 5 hours.Despite these strengths, there are also some flaws. Sometimes when I talk to someone, having the music stop can become annoying. But I changed the controls in the app so that it does not pause the music. Another flaw is that the microphone on these headphones are not good. I heard that from most of my friends, it sounds muffled and unclear. I have to carry the Apple Wired Earphones if I have a meeting to join because the microphone quality on those are better than the Sony WH-1000XM4 (though I heard that the newest one 1000XM5’s have a better microphone). However, I think it is partially my fault for not setting up the microphone. I also wished they came in more colors.Overall, these are one of the top industries’ best headphones. It is a great investment that will improve your audio/music experience. I recommend it to those who have to study a lot, travel a lot, or maybe those who like to up their music game. For the final grade, I give it an A. Depending on what you look for in headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM4’s are a good investment that will bring value to your lifestyle. Wear it with an outfit and it will also become part of the look.",02/22/2023,AE3XOTZX4POH3IUEKKHWWSFNO4GQ,1,4,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
872,R3SAGQ8WM36T2B,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound - 1st Class Noise Cancelling,Eyeconic,5,"First a side note. Do NOT order this item for overnight delivery. It is a password protected delivery which means that someone will be at your door at 4:00 AM asking for the magic incantation.I have the comparable Sony earbuds so I knew what to expect. Others will have to contend with micro-printed docs on 5 lb paper and a weird wordless diagram which requires a translation from pantomime to one's native language. HOWEVER, the Sony website has ample documentation in a readable format. Also, you need the Sony headphone app to fine tune the setup.I have acute PTSD, a consequence of gun violence. My building is undergoing major construction in th4e form of concrete restoration. I suspect that, for most people, the noise from the machines is a mere inconvenience. For me that is not the case. It's a pile driver inside my head.My earbuds were doing the job (these products have the best noise-cancelling of any device I have tried). However, they have limited battery life. The headphones solve that problem. I CANNOT HEAR A SOUND FROM THE CONSTRUCTION. Moreover, I have modest hearing loss in one ear. Hearing aids balance things out and the headphone can be worn over the aids.I have a large music collection (mostly jazz and classical) ripped losslessly (flac) to large USB drives. The drives are attached to an Nvidia Shield Pro which is an Android TV device. Bluetooth paired right up, has decent range (not requiring LOS) and connects via LDAC (which is what you want for the best quality). I then use Kodi for playback of music and movies.On the left side is an on-off button and another button that can be programmed via the app. On the right, the side of the speaker is actually a mouse pad which allows you to control both volume and your player (Kodi is imperfect in that regard but it works fine with the app on my phone).The music is flat AS IT SHOULD BE. Competing devices seem to be made for the average 16-year-old, artificially pumping up the bass. If unnatural noise is what you want, there are plenty of IOS and Android equalizer apps. In any event Mr. Mozart sounds like he should. Most jazz includes a bass that comes through exactly as it would in a live performance. Well, not exactly because we experience bass physically as well as through hearing.One final note. These things are big. I have an average-sized head (something my former employees would disagree with). The earpieces are not extended at all and the thing is a bit bigger than my headspace. Also, I wish that they were just a tad lighter.So, in the final analysis, these offer excellent sound reproduction that is accurate, rich and natural. The controls (which include a mouse pad on the right speaker) allow you to control your device and volume. The noise cancellation could not be better. There are no compromises making this a reasonable value.",02/21/2023,AGUUWIFY7DIFIWQRWV2JKBCOWEIQ,1,71,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

Taking them off one ear a little fixes the issue. Other than that, the noise canceling is great.

876,R2VY38AB0K4XQ8,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Would recommend,Yanet,5,"I bought these in December so I haven't had these for long. The overall experience is amazing and Ive been loving my music a lot more but the headphones leak noise once you exceed a certain volume so if you're putting them in blast everyone will hear what you're listening to. The only thing I can compare it to are my AirPods pros but between the two I would go with these headphones, you really get to feel the music and feel like you're really there.The headphones feel like you could easily break with a single wrong move or turn them the wrong way, they do provide a case so you're fine putting them in a bag, but it's large and bulky, so if you're carrying a lot of things in your bag it most defiantly will take a lot of your space. I haven't used it for working out but I personally wouldn't because it slides off my head whenever I look down or move too quickly so it does get irritating.Overall I say buy these headphones if you to really change the way you listen to music, if you're a generally a careful person there shouldn't be a reason for them to break, they just feel a little cheap for the price you pay for.

878,R3P26OHTQWKSVU,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfection. Close...but no ciggar!,A VERY private person,5,"This item has everything you'd want to have in a noise cancelling device: great sound, good level of noise reduction. BTW, it does NOT cancel the background noise - it reduces it to very low levels. You might not notice it, though, if you're the kind of person who listens full blast to your rap or metallica music.The headphones work great in an airplane. They successfully knocked off the engines noise, and even attendants' voices on a 5-hour flight to N. Carolina. The headphones come with airplane adapters, so you can hook them up to the airplane's entertainment center. The fit is also good - I didn't feel any pressure points over my ears or on my head, where the headband rests.Where the noise reduction doesn't work well is in windy conditions. If you ride a bicycle, run, or walk in some wind, you will hear the wind no matter how you set up the noise reduction. This is because of the position of the microphones that sample the outside noise - they are at the top of each ear cup (the oval openings), and thus, in the path of the wind.The user can answer a phone call, and have a nice chat over the phone while wearing the headphones. However, (s)he cannot start a call like you can with other dedicated headphones. I don't believe it's a big issue because I check the phone anyway, to see whom I'm calling.The app that comes with it is a great way to customize the headphones. Unfortunately, in order to have some features function, Sony requests some of your bio-metric data by asking you to take pictures of your ears, and send the pictures to Sony for analysis. (You do know, don't you, that the ear shapes are as unique as your fingerprints and eye retina?) In this time and age, when every company is trying to track you even in bedroom, and ""Big Brother"" spies on its citizen everywhere, I won't touch those features with a 10-foot pole if the access to these features is conditioned by giving up my privacy. Your mileage may vary.One of the awesome features of these headphones is their capability to fold. Thus, they fit neatly in their dedicated case, and don't take much space; which makes it easy to travel with them. Although Sony released a newer version addressing the sound issue with the wind, I opted to still purchase these because the newer version does not fold.How much do I like them?

In my opinion after using them for a while now I can say they are the best wireless headphones I've ever used. The sound quality is great, including the bass. They have great battery life typically lasting me 2 or more days of use between 6-8 hours a day. The active noise cancelation is great its kind of spooky at first but it becomes very comforting after you get used to it. The passive noise canceling is good too however you can still hear those around you and other important things if you are using them while out running errands and whatnot. Then there is the pass through/ ambient sound mode which in my opinion is only use full when you have it set up through the app to turn this one when it detects you talking because it makes everything very loud even amplifying sounds you might not hear or notice without them.TLDR: Amazing headphones if I could give more than 5 stars I would.",04/8/2024,AHCCO3CSLWNTYIR3IOXIVDTSVQCA,1,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

886,RC9URIS2XOHX2,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Good First Set of Noise Canceling,That Guy,5,So far so good. Will connect to 2 devices at a time but it recognizes 3 of mine. They will conect on ther own to whichever is playing sound. That is if you connect your phone and are listening - it will on its own coneccte to the work computer. You wont be able to hear computer until you stop/pause or close your phone app. Then if you want to listen to music on phone you need to repeat by pausing computer then playing the phone and it will pick up. Cant expect much more. Connection is good as far as distance. I can got upstairs from basement out front door to mailbox and it will keep connection.,05/2/2024,AF4F45FKPIAXGKXA6YJ4K6433NKQ,1,1,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
887,RDLWJ8EVJISYF,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Great 2nd headphones,Jae Lee,4,"To give you some context: I've had 3 ANC/noise cancelling headphones now. The Sony X4s are my third. I started with a $40 pair of Taotronics. These are great for a budget pair of noise cancelling headphones. I moved up to a more expensive pair of Taotronics 90 (~$80). The Sony XM4 is my third and at this junction, I was looking for the following features:1. Better noise cancelling.2. Better comfort, that I would wear longer than an hour).3. Better sound quality (for music and podcast).4. Portability (for traveling).The Sony XM5 just came out so these XM4 were priced at $228. I'm not used to spending this much on headphones but I'm glad I decided to upgraded to these. I was on the fence about the XM5s but the ability to fold the XM4s up, plus the fact that it was priced much less was all the reason I needed to go with the XM4.Things to note about the XM4s:1. ANC - Noise cancelling is great. It covers more of the frequencies than my previous cheap pairs did.2. Ambient Sound - Ambient noise is pretty bad. When you turn noise cancelling off to talk to someone or to hear the outside world, the sound is hollow. If you want ANC headphones where ambient sound comes through clear, these XM4s are not the best. They have the feature but it's not great. Personally, I just take my headphones off when I need to talk to someone. Otherwise, I only wear these with noise cancelling on.3. Comfort - The XM4s are very comfortable. I can easily wear these for 2 hours+ without any discomfort. I've slept in these too (to help me sleep). The ear cushions are soft and pliable enough where I don't feel any pain points. As other reviewers have mentioned, because it does such a good job with noise cancelling, there will be heat that builds up inside, especially if you're exerting energy or wearing these on a wam/hot day. It's not unbearable; just something to note.4. Sound Quality - Sony has an equalizer you can mess with and it helps to fine tune the how music or speech (ie., podcasts) comes through but it's not as good as some of the higher end headphones. But again, for $228, these headphones are a good deal, especially compared to others in the same class.Note: There are other features like the auto-pause, touch navigation (ie., play/pause/next/prev, and volume), and the hand-over-ear to turn ambient noise on... These work fine for me. I like how it works but I don't consider these as PROs or CONs... They're just different and may be useful based on personal preference.Summary: I would highly recommend these noise cancelling headphones at the current price of ~$228. If you want comfort, portability, slightly better sound quality than other comparable/competing brands, this is a very good choice. If you're coming from cheaper-type headphones, these are a great upgrade. If you're on the fence between a much more expensive pair of headphones AND need a pair of affordable headphones straight away, these are a great option. I will likely purchase another in my lifetime but these will work for me for years to come until one that has better sound quality for music and speech becomes affordable [for me].",11/28/2022,AFYCJRL6M67IX6WUPQGN3JQO5ASA,1,4,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
888,R1G3YI5M4WH50,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars Oh which to choose the 4 or the 5,Casperi,5,"I chose last year's 4 model because it's more comfortable. Add in deeper headphone pads like wicked Cushion and you can't lose!!!. I tried my friends M5s and they just didn't fit right and they had begun a crack on the left part right before the slider. I have never seen the M4 do this. Trust me I see people drop headphones almost every night at the gym and every brand. The M5s always break in the same spot. I however never seen a set of M4 s break, ever after a lads ex came in and kicked them halfway across the gym room.Comedy aside the M4s sounds great,even better when you pair it with Sonys app to get the EQ and other settings.Bottom line even when I had the choice to buy Sonys M5s the M4s are much better. Adding new deeper cushions make a world of a difference if you have larger ears.""ymmv""",03/14/2024,AH6QUTIBGGLWBWIMWIQXZOZ5TGNQ,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

891,RODXFEQLR1YSO,B0863FR3S9,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best comfort fit for small heads. The hype for noise cancellation is real!,Sarah,4,"I've been looking for some noise canceling headphones and once these went on sale for Prime day, it was a no brainer that these were the headphones to get. Although there's a newer version out, many reviews have continued to praise this version and its ability to fold in on itself and greater adjustments for the ear cups. My goals for a headset were a lightweight, wireless, and noise canceling to use with my PC, phone, and video game consoles. I didn't really plan on using these for traveling since I prefer to travel very light with just some earbuds.Upon first use, I was amazed by noise canceling ability just by putting it on. Even turned off, the ear cups create a great seal around your ears against outside noise. The sound optimizer is amazing and truly does find a great setting to cancel out the most noise taking into account little details like its placement on your head and atmospheric pressure. Many reviews have stated it feels like you get transported to a different place when you use the headphones because it immerses you into your music and although I can see where they are coming from, there were times I were a bit underwhelmed from its noise canceling ability since I could still hear my fan in the background but when I removed my headphones and realized how loud the fan actually is next to me, I was like alright these are pretty good. When I'm working on my desk, sometimes people sneak up without me knowing because the noise canceling is that effective. The ambient noise with focus on voice doesn't do well when someone is talking to me and does become a hassle to remove every time, versus my Samsung earbuds' ambient mode allows me to talk to others without fully removing them from my ears.Sound quality is great in my opinion and the difference is significant from my daily Logitech headphones. I am using Logitech G435s for my PC for its superior light weight and very light pressure against my head, not really for mic and sound quality. While these headphones' 254 grams weight took some getting used to for me coming from a mere 165 grams headset, it is still quite comfortable to use for long periods of time. In the beginning, I was debating if I should return them because they didn't fit as well on my small head as the small Logitech g435s did and the Sonys ear cups put significant uncomfortable pressure against my jaw and side of head, but after using them as my daily for weeks, the pressure loosened and has become a lot more comfortable. I barely feel any discomfort nowadays, but the pressure against my jaw is still present and noticeable. While snug enough to use for work, these are too loose to use on my small head during exercise. They fall off my head very easily and are too warm for me to use during strenuous activity. These are too expensive to risk breaking at the gym. Because my head is a bit too small for these headphones, I have to be more conscious of the headband placement. I find myself readjusting it on my head more often than my previous headset, but this small annoyance wasn't big enough to warrant a return yet.I really like these headphones and the noise cancellation is amazing! Sound quality is great. However, ambient mode for having conversations without removing the headphones is poor. Battery life is great, but I haven't tested it to its limits yet. Touch gestures and use of buttons have worked well for me, no issues. I'd say that the comfort level is a B tier for my small head, but manageable. Heavier than what I'd like. This is where the headphones score the worst for me, but everything else is pretty good and I'm more than happy with this purchase for the price.",07/24/2022,AGIYWPZ2FJWADZSWTIUZ5OQLRSHQ,1,7,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

895,R3TUSBANMTQS7N,B0863FR3S9,5.0 out of 5 stars All Inclusive and Fully Delivering,Julian Sanchez,5,"These headphones work perfectly for everything I need them for, be it gaming, work conferencing, or listening to music. The sound quality and customizability is best when used on a phone in conjunction with the app, but it works just fine everywhere else too. I've never received a complaint while on a call with them.I personally listen to plenty of EDM and bass heavy music, and I gotta say that these headphones deliver like none other I've owned. The app again is the most useful in this aspect, allowing full EQ customizing and direct control over the bass quality. Here the noise cancelation can also be set or modes can be set for the adaptive noise cancelation.When the headphones drop the ball a little is when you use a different device which doesn't support the app. At this point they'll default to whatever your last settings were on the app in terms of noise cancelation, EQ, and volume. If you really want to work around this however it's a simple task to pair your phone as the secondary device to the headphones and control them from there while listening to your primary. The auto switch between multiple paired devices depending on audio input is also great, being able to do this fluently was a big factor for me when shopping. Pairing across multiple devices is really easy after the first time paired, most times automatic.The final positive point I'll address is the touch controls on the right ear cup. I've seen many listing this as a fail point for these headphones, and I was hesitant about it at first too due to my previous headphones employing physical buttons. However, I've had no issue with the touch controls and actually find them quite convenient. They're not as sensitive as I've seen some claim, maybe they fixed this in a software patch. I've worn these under a hoodie without triggering the controls.I've been using these almost daily for the past 2 months and I've really only come across two troublesome points. The first is that paradoxically despite having multiple microphones which work during wireless use for calls, when you plug the included aux cable into your device for wired use, the headphones only provide audio and on a call use the connected device's microphone. This was very inconvenient for me as I tried to use the headset in a wired format for game chatting and was held back by the lack of a microphone on the remote, an issue I didn't have with my previous headset. When attempting to make a wired call with my phone in my pocket this became an issue as well for obvious reasons, which is when I first noticed this design.The second issue I've had is one of comfort. Now don't get me wrong these headphones are comfortable and I wear them for multiple hours at a time, but sometimes my left ear enters in discomfort after these extended periods due to the inner design of the left ear cup. As advertised the headphones detect when you take them off and stop playback accordingly, but to accomplish this they use a rather large sensor in the interior of the left ear cup. This sensor ends up pressing against the tip of my ear and becomes annoying after some time, but its not usually an issue and thus not a big enough problem to stop me from wearing them daily for hour long sessions.All in all I fully recommend these headphones as long as the two issues noted above aren't a deal breaker for you. They've served me well and I've felt like I've gotten value for my money.",03/28/2021,AHJFFVMMENIBY5VX736WVMJZCHBA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

My bedroom contains the entrance to the underworld so it's usually around 81F/27C even with the A/C cranked. Because of this I have a rather loud tower fan right next to my computer desk. When I first power on these headphones I actually checked the fan to make sure it was still running. The headphones cut out the sound completely!

900,R350RH0BWMBO33,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Want ANC Headphones with $$$ sound but under $60? These deliver that & more IMHO UPDATE Dec 2023,Carolina,5,"Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019! Ankar is truly hard to beat. Just in case you’re looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause. On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy & Anker’s reputation for quality.I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results. They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price. He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn’t pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones. 2) the headband could use a slight redesign. Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled so I have to adjust them & keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about. Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound. I like a variety of music & I hear good bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I’ve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones. That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE: if you’ve read my review you know I’ve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it’s Nov 29 2023. I thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight. The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I’d loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn’t buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on. These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I’m jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I’m thrilled for Anker’s dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn’t sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance. When I’m looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I’ve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping",07/26/2020,AFSQEHFGI4GKAV6ZLXDEBCO5FQPQ,1,374,Color: Black
901,R1BQMJJBRP2JKK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation for and unbeatable price,Ollie,5,"I have never owned a high-end Bose or Sony noise cancellation headphone so understand the context of my experience.My use case is commuting on Amtrak while also using those hours to work, and at home, drowning out outside music and neighbors loudly chatting. This Q20 performs perfectly for my needs. All the background noise on the train is barely audible and the sound quality of music and lectures is perfect as far as I'm concerned. One weakness is that voices are still relatively clear due to background noise being muted.In comparison to the Beats Studio Pro which I previously used and costs 3x as much, the Q20 is superior in sound quality, noise cancellation and comfort. The Q20 also presses evenly around the ear while the Beat Studio Pro exerts more pressure on the lower end of the headphone and presses harshly against the jaw while less on the upper end. Very uncomfortable at least for me. Q20 is the entry level and with an entry level price but outstanding performance. I've wondered if I should have purchased the Q30 or 45 but considering the comparison with Beats, I'm extremely happy with the Q20. Per some of the other reviews regarding build quality, I do handle mine gently though.",06/12/2024,AHGYTRNPF27FJ5DP2NZIJQEFBU7Q,1,10,Color: Black

I was getting tired of fiddling around with the silicone wing attachments for the AirPods.The quality of these Q20’s seems pretty decent and they are comfortable, though I haven’t worn them for an extended period of time.The sound quality isn’t as great as what you would expect from a more expensive set of headphones, but that was to be expected and they sound pretty good for the price.Noise cancellation in general is pretty weird to me, so I’m not sure how good or bad it is in these Q20’s when it works, but I wasn’t impressed. When I tested it sitting in my room, it did a decent job at drowning out the ambient noise like the hum of my fan, etc. I did notice that ANC does reduce the volume a bit.However, at the gym I felt like the ANC was struggling to work properly. While I was on the stationary bike, it kept alternating between drowning out the ambient noise and letting it through. It sounded as if I was lifting one of the ear cups and then setting it back over my ear repeatedly. Didn’t notice it too much after that, but not sure if I just got used to it.The bass boost feature does add a little more thump to your music but sacrifices audio clarity, so I definitely wouldn’t use it.Overall, these are a decent pair of headphones for $40, audio quality is good, ANC is alright, and they are comfortable.",05/27/2024,AHJQELHY4ARFZHT5HDCBSP3UVGQQ,1,12,Color: Black

I bought it because I wanted something for my flight overseas to reduce the plane hum noise which drastically reduces jet lag.So I bought this and I was amazed how great it wasPros:* great construction, feels sturdy* good choice of colors* came with USB charge cable and regular 3.5mm (I think) jack wire so it plugged into all audio out* bluetooth pairs fast and easily* noise cancelation is excellent* sound quality overall is just amazing* the thing goes over your ears nicely without hurting your ears or making it feel like it's on fire after an hour. It has soft padding and cushioned so it really helps* you feel the whoosh -> reduced sound as soon as you put it over your ear and it auto-enables noise cancel when you power it on which is great and tells you ""Battery high"" etc. which is great* battery life is amazing. Charged it once for like 2-3hours to max and it worked for 15hr flight to and another 15hr flight back and it still said Battery high. I didn't use it all the time. Maybe for like 60-70% of the time which is still great* colors are nice and make it look classy.* it doesn't cause any issues with the band over the head* you can use it wired without needing to power it on so it uses extremely little battery* the controls are fine and the ear muffs are labeled R and L which is a nice touch* haven't tested bluetooth range but I figure it is maybe standard of working across a large room* price is very good for the performance. Sure it is not a Bose ($350+) or JVC ($200+) or some others but for $40-$50 this is truly fantastic.Cons:* the one and only con I found is if you plug in the audio jack the noise cancelation turns off immediately which is a shame. So on the plane I was watching a movie where the audio came in nicely but I could hear the little plane hum as well (it was muted but not noise canceled).Other:* didn't test the bass boost but I'm sure it is great.Overall, I liked it so much I bought 2 of them. My teenage son loved it too and he said they're really great quality and works well.

904,R15YTZVPTWKV6S,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best budget friendly gym headphones,Landon,5,"I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice. It delivers superb sound, effective noise cancellation, and great comfort, all at an affordable price point. Highly recommended!Rating: ★★★★",06/3/2024,AGZH6GARXYABDTU7THGRECVT27HA,1,35,Color: Black

These headphones have absolutely phenomenal battery life. The only reason I charged them was because I wanted to test how long they would last on a full charge (within my day to day use). I received these headphones on the 1st of April. It is currently the 27th of April and the battery is still at ""Medium"" (there is no visual indicator, however there is a voice that tells you whether your battery is ""High"", ""Medium"", or ""Low"").That being said, I'll go ahead and list some Pros:- Battery Life (Seriously, I can't stress enough how good it is)- Sound Quality- Comfort- Looks- Sturdiness/Build Quality- Noise Cancellation (there's a caveat here, continue reading to see what I mean)BATTERY LIFE:As if I haven't already said enough, these headphones refuse to die. I've used them from anywhere between an hour to 3-4 hours at a time (long gaming sessions or binging a show on my laptop or phone), and they just don't let up. Like I mentioned in the intro, it's been almost an entire month with these headphones and I've only had to charge them once. It is worth mentioning that the battery will drain much faster with noise-cancelling turned on, as it is indeed ACTIVE noise-cancelling and uses more power. I've got to give props to Anker for marketing these as lasting 40 hours, as this runtime is more accurate when noise-cancelling is ON. With ANC off, these can easily last 60+ hours. It's always refreshing to see a company slightly under-sell and over-deliver.SOUND QUALITY:These things sound way better than they should at this price-point. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have experience with over-ear, closed-back studio headphones (I own a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's), and dabble in amateur sound mixing/mastering as a guitarist. Apart from being just a bit heavier on the bass than I would like, these headphones do an excellent job at bringing out lows, mids, and highs in pretty much anything you'll find yourself listening to. Nothing sounds drowned out or overexposed (with the exception of the bass, but there's a valid reason for it in this case). I bought these headphones primarily for multimedia consumption (movies, video games, music, etc.). They have just the right amount of punch in the low-end to make things such as explosions or bass-heavy sound effects really shine. In this instance, the heavier low-end makes sense. Voices sound crystal clear, as the mids don't get drowned out by the lows or highs like on some other higher-priced headphones (looking at you, Beats..). The highs are where these things truly shine, in my opinion. Lots of budget headphones tend to sound very ""tinny"" with harsh, sharp highs to over-compensate for the overly-saturated bass, but these do a great job at keeping both the mids and highs prominent enough (despite the thicker bass).COMFORT:I've owned and used plenty of both over-ear and on-ear headphones over the years, and I can't beat around the bush here: these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I was expecting to have to ""break them in"", given what some of the other reviews were saying, but the minute I put these on I was pleasantly surprised at just how soft and light these felt (without feeling cheap or flimsy). And I wear glasses!LOOKS:Not a whole lot to say about how these look. I wouldn't say you'll be turning heads while wearing these out and about, but for the amount of money that they cost.. I'm just saying they could've looked a lot worse. I've seen headphones three times the price that are a complete eye-sore. The Q20s are clean and minimalistic, without giving away its low price.STURDINESS/BUILD QUALITY:Although I'm not one to man-handle my devices (no matter how little they may cost), I have to say that these don't feel the least bit flimsy. I did a mild stress-test by stretching both ear cups apart as far as I was comfortable with and was able to get about 10 inches wide. I don't think anyone has a head that wide, but if you do, these are definitely going to fit. The build quality feels great, and I feel like these will definitely last a while (and I will be updating this review if that changes lol).NOISE CANCELLATION:These headphones do indeed have active noise cancelling, BUT.. I literally almost NEVER use it. Here's why: they don't need it. The headphones are built in such a way that even with the ANC off, they drown out a ton of outside noise. Unfortunately, there is a significant drop in volume when noise-cancelling is activated. The bass takes a hit as well, making it more evened out with the mids and highs (which might be a plus for some).FINAL THOUGHTS:There's only really one ""Con"" that I wasn't going to mention, and that's the carrying bag that comes with the Q20s. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I did just want to note that they used to come with a hard carrying case (according to some older YouTube reviews), and I'm a little salty that us newer buyers don't get that lol. All in all, for the $60 that I paid for these headphones, I can't think of any reason not to fully recommend them. They sound great, the battery life lasts incredibly long (almost to a suspicious degree, making you feel like today is finally the day it'll need a charge only to be proven wrong), it's got decent looks, solid build, and they even threw in Active Noise Cancellation for situations that call for some extra silence. If you're in the market for some new headphones for multimedia consumption (I definitely would not use these for any professional work, as they are not made for that), and have a bit of a stiffer budget, look no further. These will do more than its price tag leads on.",04/27/2023,AG2IY3MWQWDS3BEK37557MIKDP2Q,1,544,Color: Black
906,R3HQTCIS9L4E3N,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great performance and comfort for transcribing,Krista,5,"I've had these Soundcore Anker LQ20 headphones for a year and have been using them heavily the entire time. They're still going strong and I love them. They're comfortable and the noise cancellation is good. I work from home as a transcriptionist, and I use them for a few hours to several hours a day. They do a good job of blocking or significantly reducing background noises like TV, a noisy AC, lawn mowers, and nearby semi-loud voices. If you use the button to turn off the active noise canceling feature, you'll hear the difference right away.This pair was my first time trying bluetooth headphones for transcribing. I wasn't sure if the sound quality would be as good as wired headphones/good enough for me to accurately transcribe all speech from the audio files I work with, including ones with difficult audio, and I also wondered if there would be any issues with the bluetooth connection being spotty or something. They have worked perfectly and I find them to be very good transcription headphones.I have to charge them fairly often since I use them so much, but I think they have at least average battery life between charges. I usually charge as soon as I notice the voice says ""Battery medium"" at startup because I've learned they'll probably run out in the middle of my work session if I try to wait until it says ""Battery low."" I don't think I've ever even heard ""Battery low.""Great headphones, reasonable price, no complaints.",06/23/2024,AGS2HV55N4RN6XK44IT7I5KYHFUA,1,8,Color: Black
907,R1L3WIHPNVR4FI,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Awesome, but maybe wont last as far as build",Jerry Adams,4,"I purchased 2021. Now in 2024 they are starting to break down, it started with band plastic part randomly breaking off. Now the fake leather is starting to peel pretty bad. There are a few factors that could be causing this. 1. I dont store them in the pouch it came with (its my jewelry bag now). 2. I had them hanging on my office desk near my humidifier which i would put essential oils in. And 3 the headphones were in the sun often because my desk was near a window and i live in California.Despite all that this year was the 1st year i used them on an airplane and watched Dune for the 1st time. Noise cancelling was on point, and the sound was beautiful. Besides having pieces of leather on my shirt when taking them off they are still rockin and fit great. Didnt need to charge them the entire trip from California to Africa and back. Well worth the price. Great sound, buttons easy to use, connects to 2 devices with ease.",06/23/2024,AFA7U5BYN6KC2DRKQ4BFC63JQANA,1,11,Color: Black
908,R1REYVNBG5AVBE,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars There are no better BT headphones under $100,Carl Payne,5,"UPDATE: Added the 5th star. Read the review with edits at the end.Wow. I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous. I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers. The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive. The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great. My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year. I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?! Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable. I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great. MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy. After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (""Sacrilege,"" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care. The ""silent note"" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately. The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.So I tested the ANR. I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again. The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys. I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys). THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys. Period. It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere. I mean it. They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR. They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8"" jack.Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies. I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application. If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away. If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.1. The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears. Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight. It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in. If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.2. The battery life isn't that great. To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them. However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without. My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48. Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.3. They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs. This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have. Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).Hope that helps you make a decision. I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.UPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star. The earphone cushions did ""break in,"" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable. Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones. On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine. When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.Battery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically. Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.Finally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC. These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted. I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good. I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.Five stars. When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.",09/2/2022,AGD5QTRAY6ASQKN7OMV3PC6POPSQ,1,1628,Color: Black
909,R1ABEIBHVJQEA4,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice in budget friendly headphones,Miranda,4,"They're perfect for what I'm using them for-- but definitely read first before buying, because the upgraded version may be what you're looking for.I am incredibly sensitive to headphones (as opposed to earbuds). My head is really sensitive to pressure, and even with light headsets I can start getting a migraine with constant pressure in one spot for too long. My ears also experience the same sensitivity-- they go numb/get tingly pain very easily with on-ear sets.I've been using my Airpod Pros as my go-tos for three years now, but I wanted over-ears for when I'm playing my keyboard piano-- it just gives a better atmospheric sound and nuance, in my opinion. So because of this, it was really important to me to get a pair that could be wired, on top of being bluetooth for versatility. I also prefer a wire option for AIRPLANES! If you ever want to watch an in-flight movie, you still need an aux cable these days. Surprisingly, it was difficult to find a model of headphones that still offer both options. It was a big reason I went with these.CHARGING/BATTERY:The first con is that these use micro USB to charge. Most updated tech is moving to USB-C, and I don't have any other devices that still use micro cables. When I travel with these, I need to remember to bring that designated cord. (Note, the Q20i model has USBC charging) On the other hand, the impressive battery life (60H with ANC off, 40 with it on) does help with that. I also like that it tells you verbally the battery level when you turn them on, so you get a heads up of what the charge is at. However, my apple devices also give me a battery percentage indicator for more accurate levels.EAR CUPS/NOISE CANCELLATION:The over-ear design is so much more comfortable than on-ear, and even helps enhance the active noise cancellation. A lot of external sound is filtered out even with ANC off because of how these cup around your ears snugly (but not too tightly!). My ears fit all the way inside comfortably. As I type this, I have cleaners in my home running a vacuum downstairs and I didn't even notice until I took the headphones off.COMFORT:When I first opened these up and put them on, I felt that the cups were putting slight pressure inward against my head, but after wearing them for ~5hr they seem to have already ""broken in"" and it's not noticeable anymore. As far as the top of the headset, I will say there's not a ton of cushion, but it's enough for these to feel okay for hours on my sensitive head.SIZING:They're not that heavy but they do press down a bit on my head because they're SLIGHTLY large on my head. I'm a 5'4"" woman, I'd say pretty average sized head?? lol - but these do feel a bit big on me. I don't think I would use them for working out or running, something as small as even just looking downward is enough to have them slightly slip. In general I do prefer working out with earbuds anyway just due to sweat, so that's not what I really bought these for anyway but thought I'd mention for any other petite women. Because of this, these are for sure going to be more for piano / computer / travel.BASS/SOUND:I feel like there was mixed reviews about the bass capabilities. Even with the BassUp feature off, I feel like the bass is great on these without distorting! I listen to Billie Eilish a lot, who is known for very bass-heavy music. Without BassUp, her songs sound well balanced (while still obviously bass-heavy). With BassUp on, you get that fuzzy feeling in your ears when the bass kicks in (but still no distortion). Speaking of Billie, she also utilizes stereo sound a lot (some sounds in left ear, some sounds in right) and it sounds great in these. Note that there is no transparency mode on these, but the Q20i model has that if it's a must for you.CONNECTIVITY:This was a big one for me, and probably the reason I am going to be returning these for the upgraded Q20i. I've been spoiled by my Airpods in terms of being able to switch between devices seamlessly (ipad/iphone/imac) without having to disconnect one device and re-pair the other. With this set, I have to go into my iPhone settings, disconnect, then pair with my computer and vice versa whenever I want to switch. It's a small annoyance but a convenience I really prefer.PRICE:I bought these on sale for $39.99 and I feel like that's a super fair price for the quality and buying from a reputable brand like Anker. I have several of their items, and they have great customer service. I'd much rather spend the extra $10-20 from the super off brands here on Amazon, just for the peace of mind that they stand by their products.",03/4/2024,AEX7BTHOU63GYGKQTAAC6HSPITZA,1,28,Color: Black
910,R325WZ955J5MAO,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Super-Solid Bang-For-Your-Buck Pair of Headphones!,Jordan Pon,4,"Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------Sound Quality ---- 8/10These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORSI only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.Comfort ---- 10/10These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.Features ---- meh, not much to talk aboutReally the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.Aesthetics ---- 6/10Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.Connectivity ---- 6/10Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)",10/23/2020,AF57TFFL4RVTI3RUQXVEO24IMNTQ,1,442,Color: Black
911,RTYYTUIZAG0EK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A Complete Review for the Average Joe,Kathy Tran,5,"This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.The Soundcore Headphones:These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.Comparability and Software:These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.Overall SoundI'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.Noise Cancelling:Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.Comparisons:Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.The Overall:Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.",11/13/2020,AEBWJZ55L7XV3T354S22VM2GQK7Q,1,678,Color: Black
912,R3TBHJ0I0G4WY0,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best purchase for an overstimulated mom!,Alex G.,5,"Let me start by saying I wasn’t paid or given the product for free to say this….these are my genuine thoughts. I started looking for some over the ear headphones bc, as a mom to a small baby, I spend a lot of time awake at night on my phone trying to stay awake! I have regular Apple ear buds and never liked them bc they don’t stay in my ear at all. I chose this soundcore product bc it had the best reviews and was in my budget. I was immediately in love. I’m no expert in sound by no means but I do love music and love when things sound so clear and crisp. This delivers so well in that. The noise cancelling is my favorite part. As a mom to a very wild toddler, I can get overstimulated to the max. This makes it so that I can hear the screaming and laughing but it sounds like through a mile long tunnel, which is PERFECT. I’m sure other people would like more noise reduction but this is amazing for me to lessen all the noise but still be alert if needed. I suffer from migraines so the fit is a huge aspect to me. They seem very comfortable so far but using them for longer will surely tell. I wish there were more colors like a pale pink but I got the silver color and it is girly enough for me! It’s something I’d definitely wear outside the house at the gym or on a walk. They haven’t gone through a drop test yet which I’m sure they will bc again, wild toddler. But they seem to be durable and not super cheaply made. I do wish there was a hard case as all it came with was a rubber plastic bag. I’m sure I could find something cheap on Amazon though to fit. Overall, I LOVE IT. Definitely a good purchase if you want a little better experience than ear buds and not break the bank!",05/23/2024,AGCAPWOIW26ZZ3SHBSLOCOG62TXA,1,1,Color: Silver

915,R2PRRSGGO8J48X,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars The Absolute BEST for Misophonia, Hyperacusis, and Sound/Sensory Sensitivity",sbonne,5,"I own so much sound defense equipment it's almost ridiculous. I have everything from Loop ear plugs to noise-canceling ear buds to sound machines to big speakers. I have a condition that makes certain sounds nd frequencies quite painful. Until now, every device I have tried had failed to provide complete relief. I wasn't expecting much of the Soundcore Q20 headphones, but if you struggle with sound sensitivity, you know the desperation for relief. My biggest battle has been my next door neighbor's lawn service, which uses equipment that measures over 90dB INSIDE my house with all the windows closed. I usually have to leave the house the moment I hear the truck pull up. Not anymore! I put the Soundcore Q20s to the test just this week, fully expecting that the lawn equipment (particularly the gas-powered leaf blowers) would make it through like it does all other devices I own, but it didn't! I was stunned! Even between songs, the noise cancellation kept my ears protected from the auditory assault I usually have to leave the house to escape. These are worth their weight in gold! I cannot recommend them enough. And in addition to being absolutely excellent at what they're designed to do, they provide great sound quality for music and they fit very comfortably. I don't usually like having things on or around my ears but these are quite tolerable. The cushioning feels nice, and there is more cushioning on the part that goes on top of your head. Oh, and the battery life? Phenomenal!! These charge quickly and the charge lasts for a very long time! Bottom line: whether you deal with hyperacusis, misophonia, sensory processing disorder, or just really value your peace and quiet, GET THESE. There are brands out there that cost a lot more and promise a better experience, but these are BY FAR superior to anything else I have ever tried. They will not disappoint! These would make a wonderful gift for the person in your life that struggles with sound or has autism or ADHD and needs relief from noise and external distractions. Literally a life-changing product. I'd give them more stars if I could!",05/12/2024,AH3JNQIYXWKIX5M3KYYWBSX6J5KA,1,7,Color: Black
916,R3QAPNJ0V6TB8M,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling without even turning on the noise canceling function!,Katie D.,4,"I have never really been a big fan of these massive headphones, but I was taking an extremely long flight and needed more than the 3 hour battery life my airpods offer. I would give these a 5 star overall review, but they are just a touch too big for my head, even at the smallest setting. I made it work for the trip but i do think it put a bit of pressure on my ears, despite some of the others reviews. If you have a normal or larger head, these will probably fit great! (I have to buy kids hats if that says anything about my tiny noggin')Overall, the battery life is incredible and these were perfect for using with the airplane screens (via 3mm jack) as well as my bluetooth on my phone. I personally think the silence they bring when you put them on even without turning on the noise canceling feature is fantastic. I really didn't have an need to turn on the feature for this particular trip. I have numerous other Anker products and I knew the sound quality should be good and it definitely was! I will say overall sound/bass sounds much better than my usual headphones. You won't find a better product for the price!",07/1/2024,AFXFNL6TMGS4SWTM6ABALOECUJKA,1,1,Color: Black
917,R2D5N7MVCP2FAP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud office? BUY THESE!,Katy Jordan,5,"Recently, a group of half a dozen younger, rather talkative, gentlemen were promoted to my department. I'm okay with chitchat at a nice reasonable level. But as the NBA Finals approached, their enthusiasm for daily conversations seemed to grow. I overheard rave reviews of various comedy and action films and television shows. I've listened to them flirt shamelessly with the one younger girl at their desk clump. I also overheard a particularly vivacious discussion about chewing gum that lasted approximately half an hour. It felt something akin to working in a locker room slash Dutch Bros. parking lot slash mall food court. Their volume grew. And grew. And I was afraid that one day I might be inclined to staple something to one of their heads if I heard one more thing about what the Mavericks can do to get more rebounds in the next game. My current earbuds were not working - I had to keep raising the volume, prolonged wearing made my ears itchy, and somehow I could still hear the boys! Desperate, I saw these headphones for a reasonable price and thought I'd take the chance.As soon as they were over my ears, it was like I'd stepped into an oasis. I could finally hear my own thoughts. Instant focus. I have become much more pleasant to be around. I no longer feel compelled to staple things to my coworkers heads. In fact, now I find these boys quite endearing and I hope all of their sports teams win.The noise cancelling is not perfect, but for the price it is amazing. I also have loop earplugs for concerts - if that helps as a reference point, these headphones cancel more noise than that. I don't have to turn the volume of my music up as high. They really are quite pleasant - that's the best word I can think of to describe them. They're adjustable, so they fit my head perfect, and perfectly cover my ears. I've heard other people say that other headphones start to feel heavy after a while and strain their necks - I have not felt that with these at all. They are comfortable, they look sleek, the battery seems to last forever, and I HIGHLY recommend them.",06/8/2024,AH73MYPRDV2TK2KOUSR4BVVTMNCA,1,49,Color: Black
918,R3L3SZ6RUZTBSX,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding, but not without their flaws",Debbie Wiggins,4,"These headphones are a great value. They are extremely lightweight and sound quality is very good. Noise cancelling works well and is not far off from their more expensive counterparts. My main complaint with these is the size of the ear cups. They are quite small and just barely qualify as ""over ear"" headphones in my opinion. Part of the ear cup actually sat on top of my ear lobes. I found that this design along with the faux-leather material used made my ears overheat too quickly. That being said, I have issues with my ears getting hot with most headphones that I have tried, so take that with a grain of salt.It is important to mention that I could not get the noise cancelling feature to work when these were functioning off of the included cable. If you plan to use these wirelessly just for listening to music from your phone this likely isn't an issue, but I was considering using these for gaming so this did not fit my use case. In addition, I feel that these do not sound nearly as good with noise cancelling turned off. When noise cancelling is on, they sound amazing. With it off, however, they sound quite cheap and the clarity seems to decrease. I'm not sure what would cause this, but that is just my experience with them.I got these on sale for $40, so these are definitely a great value at that price point. If the negatives I mentioned are not deal breakers for you, I highly recommend picking these up when they are on sale.",06/4/2024,AHSWFP7XSW3WSEK2XFIOZOMVMP2A,1,3,Color: Black
919,R8A53BVTBUUTM,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!,Wendell Powell,5,"First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..",02/7/2020,AHAP5LT732R5D4AMGRRZYHQCNNJQ,1,489,Color: Black
920,R3JEJFEWVA44XJ,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Nice sound quality but the fit takes some getting used to,Whit,4,"The controls on the headphones are really easy to use whether you want to pause whatever you’re listening to or adjust the volume of your headphones without taking them off to troubleshoot (my last pair from a different brand were so hard to pause, adjust volume, etc so this is a really great perk for my new headphones). I ordered the black pair and they look great. They’re easy to connect with my Bluetooth on my phone however the distance I can be away from my phone while I am connected isn’t that great. But if you keep your phone on or near you while you use them it isn’t an issue. The noise canceling feature works pretty well. I haven’t tried them in a super busy and loud setting yet but they do a good job dulling the sound of my lawn mower and leaf blower while I’m doing my yard work. The fit takes some getting used to. If I wear them too long my ears get sore and the top of my head where the strap sits starts to hurt too. But I haven’t worn over the ear headphones in a really long time so it may just be that my head and ears need time to get used to the new set up.

I was blown away by the ability to be noise canceling at the touch of a button. These came in today and I’ve been wearing them all day! I can’t say that I notice any difference between them and the AirMax. I own a vast amount of headphones, most that I’ve gotten off Amazon below $30. These were the first pair I spent more on, got them for $39.99 on sale from $59.99. I’m just a headphone junkie. These are fantastic! I’m obsessed and they are now my favorite pair. I will probably be purging some old ones soon. They’re all fairly decent for how much I paid for them, but these are absolutely my favorite!

Placement is good and easy to use when on my head. Noise canceling works very well actually very quiet even without noise canceling on and works well for phone calls. I have even had people comment that it was clearer when i switched from my EarPod pros to this head set. Thinking of buying a few more to give away as gifts. Would purchase again.

923,R3V6S1FQYWLWPU,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars An Honest, Unbiased Review **UPDATED**",Marc,4,"UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many ""name brand"" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless ""no-name"" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony & Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.PROSComfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.CONSNoise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.",01/25/2020,AFWC3HQORHDCFQJN4P76FBRXOI7A,1,33,Color: Black
924,R3LYQ2WI5N0KRF,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good For Our TV Use, But Question the BT 5.3 Rating",Bob in Central Oregon,5,"We bought two of these to use for TV listening. We have a large difference in how much TV volume we need, and the easiest solution is two headphones with individual volume adjustments. I have a long history of success with Anker products so had no problem selecting these from the large assortment of BT headphones available on Amazon in this cost class. At the same time I bought a https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G8Q7NXZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details transceiver for the TV, also with BT 5.3 low-latency claimed.The headphones paired easily with the transceiver. The sound quality is fine, and they link up quickly when powered on. The only disappointment is that there's a very noticeable lag in the audio, even with both components claiming the low-latency with BT 5.3. Unfortunately I have no other BT 5.3 pieces to substitute to isolate the cause of the lag. Since they will be used with the TV speaker turned off, the lag isn't as critical an issue as it might be if the TV speaker was still audible while wearing the headphones. Were I serious about testing/solving, I'd me much more inclined to swap he transceiver first.I did the first test while pairing with the transceiver plugged into my tablet, listening to a music stream. My vintage (read: old) ears liked the bass-boost function for the music, so one set of headphones has that selected. K has hearing loss in upper mid to treble range so bass boost would not benefit her, and in fact would be counterproductive. Hers is switched off. Nice to have that easy option. I have no other sound options selected at this early time.Yes I would buy them again. They are comfortable, fold nicely if I was planning to pack them for travel, certainly light weight on the head, and they will serve our needs nicely.",05/2/2024,AGEBMVNXJABW4OKRV2MP7NS6FX6A,1,3,Color: Black
925,R1HU59G1M7L7AJ,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good!,Philip J. Mumola,5,"I usually use in ear wireless buds when it comes to cutting my lawn with my tractor, but the motor bleeds in and the music is not very enjoyable because of that. I went online to review over the ear wireless headphones and the first ones on the list were Bose at a hefty price of somewhere around $250. I was gonna buy them but then I saw these as the 2nd on the list at $49!!They mention the “active noise reduction” feature, so I figured, ya can’t go wrong with that price these days. The reviews were plentiful but, I’m very weary of excessive Amazon reviews because, for the most part, it basically tells me that the product was inexpensive.Nevertheless I purchased them and WOW!Syncing to my iPhone was a breeze. I start my tractor, put on the music and I’m like damn, the engine is still loud. I the hit and hold, (for a second) the “NC”, ( noise canceling) button and THE EFFING MOTER SOUND DISAPPEARED! All I had was great music 🎶 coming into my ears!I can’t tell you how this makes my lawn cutting experience so much better! Now, when I’m up to my last strip of grass, I’m saddened that I’ll have to wait another week to do this again.Oh yes. I highly recommend them.",05/22/2024,AHAHOEJG6CYMZSI6ZTO72P3PQ33A,1,0,Color: Black
926,R5SDX41KD57A9,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones,Steven Lavey,5,"I've been using thease headphones for a while now and I feel like I've tested them enough to give a long term review. The headphones work great from day 1. They came partially charged. Disregarding the advice of plugging in and giving a full charge before use, used it all the way to see how long it would take to fully charge. First full charge was about 2 hours. Every full charge has been between 30 to 90 minutes. This is due to the quality of charger and cord used. In the instructions it says it has a quick charge mode where 5 minutes of charge gives 2 hours. I've found this is incorrect. 5 minutes of charge gives about 2.5 hours of use at minimum. I can usually get a full or nearly full charge at 45 minutes at average. Standby mode with headphones is the longest I've seen. I powered on the headphones and needed to do something, forgot about it until 2 days later. At 2 days standby with Noise cancelation on, the charge was about 20%. Noise cancelation works great. I've been using the headphones while doing woodworking. I doubt the headphones are OSHA approved but they work great with background noise. When I was listening to anything, I did not need to adjust the volume to hear anything. While I know this company as a very reliable company for USB cords and chargers, the headphones and earbuds they make are some of the best I've used and an excellent value. The only recommendation I would make is to change the charging port from micro USB to USB C, but I'm sure they've already corrected it with other models. There's not many companies out there that I'd ever consider myself a fan of, let alone recommend their products to close family members, this company is certainly one I do. The fit if the headphones are perfect, even with people who wear glasses.",04/28/2024,AEQCO42XNU4WFC6TTDMJOKFJNB5A,1,11,Color: Blue
927,R3L3H4KCFQM4L,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars These are excellent headphones!,Nkco Tigerman 🐅,5,"NEW REVIEW: I gotta give this 5 stars. I wasn't particularly fascinated by how low the sound was at first, especially with my music player mediums being at full volume... BUT THEN I eventually realized that the Noise Cancellation feature had something to do with that, so I turned it off. The EQ quality is spotless; the clarity and balance is top notch! The bass boost is very enjoyable, the product aesthetic is excellent, I love that it comes with a case for carrying and packing, the buttons are straightforward, and the headphones seem to fit well over small heads and big heads, Haha! Audiophile folks may indulge in the ANC technology, but I prefer it with that feature off because more power is needed to make the sonics more attractive to me. I prefer my headphones and earbuds to be loud enough for me to fully submerge myself in the music, so I can drown in the frequencies to catch the vibe of each song.I started with ""New Review"" because this is a modification of my prior review. I deleted my old review after discovering that turning off the ANC feature gives me the kind of loudness I enjoy when listening to music. It increased the performance of the headphones for me.",05/24/2024,AHFXESDXT5IPIGMGNBKGIFZUE2OA,1,0,Color: Black

They have been very durable, and I'm someone who is a little tougher on my things. They are comfy on my ears, and I have sensitive larger ears. While they are really nice quality for the price, I can still hear some sounds with the Noise Cancelling. I do have really good hearing, so that may be why. They are also slightly big on my head and have only fallen off during exercises with more head movements. I am a bit smaller, so I have taken that into account as well.

When I say he is loud, he is LOUD. Everyone seems to disappear when he arrives. I’m not complaining because I LOVE seeing people in the gym working on their physical health. But, he always gets me off concentration when I’m doing mind to muscle connection. These headphones are good so far. I have no complaints. The sound and noise cancelling have been a big help. I have a small head lol so these headphones are the perfect size, not too big, and is very secured on my head so I don’t have to keep pulling them up and readjusting them.

My ability to concentrate and ignore sounds around me has greatly diminished. The air handler is in my office ceiling. The IT guy's cell phone ring is obnoxiously loud. The boss sits in his office and chats on the phone all day and it drives me bonkers! These are great for blocking out all that noise. I can put these on and sit in my own personal cone of silence.

931,R1V2HAPIO5YL64,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars No noise cancelling, instead this is more like pump up the volume",William Yousef Fadel,4,"Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want ""world around dissapears"" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointingEdit #1:The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says ""Noice Cancelling"", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent) sure noice cancelling was active.«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.Edit #2:I was ""finally"" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and ""- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference."".For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song ""A a a a a a a a a Very good song"" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.I tested in various scenarios:1.) In my car, windows down.2.) In my car windows up.3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.My results:1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.But, in scenarios 5, 6 & 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.Edit #3 (and Final):Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.",07/18/2020,AF2NHPCDCZUYJXEC4KAFWB73FFRA,1,16,Color: Black
932,R2HQ7VZ4BFPVTG,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great buy for the money,Amazon Customer,5,I was hoping these noise cancelling headphones would do the trick after my much more expensive ones finally died. I was not disappointed. They arrived right before a recent trip and I used them to watch my movies on the flight. They really had a nice sound and they were able to cut out so much of the engine noise. I also have used them when I study and listen to music at home. What I noticed is how comfortable they are and how they stay on my head when I move around.

933,R14MJTIQHLNJV5,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good for the price,Jenna,4,"The noise cancelling isn’t the greatest, but for the price point, I wasn’t expecting much. They’re great for around the house, but on a plane or train, they don’t block out much. I ended up wearing foam ear plugs with these on top with sleep sounds playing, and I could still hear people around me and the engine humming.The sound quality is pretty good for music and podcasts. They’re lightweight enough for be comfortable for extended wear. And my favorite thing about them… the battery lasts forever (I use them several hours every day and only charge them once a week).I use them a lot for phone calls, and I’ve been told the microphone picks up a lot of background noise, so they’re not great if you’re trying to get other things done while talking to someone.

The build quality is very good for the price (I bought it for 40 USD). My only complain is the active noise cancelling, which when turned on, lower the bass quality of the music (on Spotify at least). That's why I don't usually turn on the active noise cancelling, the good thing is that you probably are not going to need it, I can't hear people talking when playing music.One of the best things of this product is the battery. I didn't charge it for one month and I've been using it almost all days, 3 or 5 ours by day, and just got the ""low battery"" announce.I would totally recommend this product.",06/12/2024,AEJBFO24VD72AJELCJWHHM4MVAEQ,1,0,Color: Black

The sound quality and build quality is up to par on the new ones, and the ANC works considerably better.***********So these are pretty okay **for the price**. The sound quality is decent but I wouldn't say outstanding by any means. Actually seem to get better sound through Bluetooth than wired which seems odd but hey you're buying BT phones anyways so... The noise cancellation is very weak, basically non-existent it seems to only filter out lows, like I can still hear my fan running in my window 15ft from me. Controls are simple and easy to use. My main gripe is that every time you move you can hear the various joints and whatnot creaking. Overall for like sitting watching a movie without disturbing your partner, grand, but I wouldn't use them as like day-to-day walking around cans if you really love your music. Would not personally buy again but they serve their purpose as cheapos after my last good ones fell apart from years on years of use and abuse.",05/24/2024,AG6WHJ4ENPTJVLFSALGUUFJ4YBHQ,1,0,Color: Black

Sure. They’re not Sony. They’re not Sennheiser. But if you’re like me and you just need some tunes to tune out the world when you’re commuting, walking, working, or eating, these do the job.Keep in mind, I treat my headphones like garbage. I lost the case/bag it came in so any time I don’t need it, it gets stuffed in my backpack or thrown somewhere for me to find later. After more than a year of this kind of use, it’s still sturdy and holding strong. I haven’t even put duct tape on it, which is more than what I can say about my previous pair.Will I get the same exact pair after this inevitably dies? …No. There are better options out there nowadays. But if you’re looking for a gift for a cranky high schooler or a new college admit…hell, I’d do anything for a pair of these my freshman year in college rather than the 5 other bad, dollar-store hand-me-downs I went through.Brief description about its functionality because you might need to keep this in mind: They’re very comfortable. I’ve fallen asleep in these before. However, they do have a tendency to slip off after continuous usage so I don’t really recommend this if you’re looking to run or jog or work out. They fold in, which is great for storage. They sit around my neck easily but I have weird sensory issues with that so I don’t usually rest them there. (It’s not uncomfortable but it’s also not comfortable.) And one final thing: lately, they’ve needed a LOT of time to charge. HOWEVER, even since I’ve gotten these headphones, they last an INCREDIBLE amount of time. I think my first few times using it I’ve literally had it on 5-7 hours a day for like, two weeks, and it still has charge on it. The battery life is god tier. Nowadays, it has been more like 4-6 hours for 1 1/2-2 weeks before I need to charge it. I’ve left these suckers on during classes and meetings and man, I’m always surprised by the voice telling me I’m still on a medium charge.Don’t take my word for it though. I got a couple of friends who have been rocking their own pairs of q25s for about as long as I have, if not longer.These are solid. If you don’t want to break the bank, I’d recommend these. $300-400 for a pair of headphones in this economy?? 🤧",02/1/2024,AEYTP46M5XLLQ4WHQ54KZK742HVQ,1,6,Color: Black

With that being said, as far as cost goes, Anker is up there in price, but not the MOST expensive. For the price point on noise cancelling headphones, I went with these and let me tell you they are AMAZING! I know someone that paid twice as much for their noise cancelling headphones and I like these better! The noise cancelling is a God send, its helps me study and relax in peace. If you only have noise cancelling on and no other noise playing, you will still hear SOME noise, but it is much more muted and quiet. The sound quality on these far exceeds my expectations. If you need heavy, heavy bass, these might not be for you, but they do the job for me. The charge for me, lasts days, with the headphones being on for multiple hours per day. One downfall I want to mention is you cannot use these and charge them at the same time (unless maybe I'm dong something wrong), but that wasn't a huge deal for me anyway as I just let them charge overnight. These are soooooo great, I let my friend borrow them and he ended up buying himself and his mom a pair!

Can't comment on noise cancellation - I care not for it. Decent volume output. Just use the minjack on the front output of your PC as that is equipped with a mic booster or you will get really soft output from using a back mic output (bluetooth has no such limitations). I'm happy. Can I get better for twice the price? Sure I just have different priorities. I treat them will definite care as with rough handling them light not last, but I treat all my kit with kid gloves.

They are comfortable and the sound quality is great. I have worked out in them so I will have to update my review to see if the material will peel with all the sweating. I hope not. The bass and noise canceling have a button to turn it on/off, which is nice. It was easy to connect to my phone and tablet. I think I read that you can have several devices connected at the same time. Unlike some headphones where you could only have one connected at a time. I would recommend purchasing these headphones. A con would be the plastic carrying case. It doesn't protect the headphones if in a backpack or bag.",05/26/2024,AFHHT5LDVZP2V6HI7BTFRVPVBHRA,1,0,Color: Black
949,R2WYWIS8VYQSX6,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, noise cancellation, & comfort. Also the sound and the comfort. No Regerts.",Kenneth M. Green,5,"I saw these on a Today's Deal sale, and like a drug addict that likes hopscotch, I busted out the chalk sidewalk and started researching.Everyone loves these headphones. Your mom will love these headphones. They are not $300 Bose ANC headphones. (ANC stands for Always Be Closing. Sit Down. Coffee is for closers.) But they are 80-90% as good as Bose Active Noise Cancelling headphones at 1/5 the cost. You'll need to ask your kid or younger brother to help with that Algebra, but let's just say x = incredible value.Apparently Soundcore is an Anker company. This isn't obvious in some of the reviews you will undoubtedly read while on the toilet. But it's Anker made. Who hasn't had great experience with Anker stuff? Your purchase history here on Amazon already has 14 Anker purchases. This won't be your first or your last Anker purchase. Aside from making you feel dumb with your friends because no one can agree how to pronounce the ""a"" in Anker, their products are solid performers at a good price.And that's how I'd describe these headphones - like a really nice Honda amongst Acura, Lexus, etc. Or a really good TV dinner where they get the cheese right. These Soundcores are not beautiful. They won't help you get the girl (or the guy. or the cute non-binary person you saw Wednesday). But they absolutely will make you feel glad you bought them.They are solid in the hand, if a little cheap feeling - but only next to high end headphones. They aren't flimsy by any stretch (do not try to stretch them). The plastic is thick and has a matte finish. The headband adjustment is solid - easy to move and stays in place once set. Comfort is excellent. The earphone cushions are buttery soft (and not all greasy like butter. That would be gross. Butter on your ears sucks.) The soft ear cushions make a great seal on your ears and don't hurt after wearing for hours, even with glasses.Some reviewes mention that these headphones can get a little sweaty. That does not mean the headphones themselves. These headphones produce almost zero perspiration themselves. But they may make your head/ears/ear area sweat. Because of the great seal made by the cushions, and due to the material being all natural vinyl or something, it can make things a little warm after an hour. But if you're sitting at the bus stop in this humid heat, your ears are gonna sweat. At least these headphones will protect your ears from the loud noises of the bus and the other people at the bus stop who won't stop talking about Sammy and why he took off. You don't need to hear that story again. Poor Sammy.The ANC (not the chain of movie theaters) is good. For headphones at this price, the noise cancelling is excellent. So I guess that means the noise cancelling is excellent. At this price. These aren't high end Bose, dum-dum. These will remove a lot of exterior sound like a droning fan, dogs barking, a baby crying, a spouse asking you to do something, a police officer telling you that you can't lie here, a drive through operator asking you want you want over and over and over.I haven't tried these on a plane yet. But I will. If I say I'll come back and update this review after using them on a plane, that would feel disengenuous, because we both know that's not going to happen. I feel like there is a modicum of trust and intimacy established at this point, and I don't want to harm that. So let's just agree to disagree, OK? I bet these will be great on a plane.Sound is really really good. I won't say excellent because you might like artificially enhanced Beats-like bass response, and if you do, trying to explain what ""subjective"" means will take too long. I'm kidding. If you really like a bunch of bass, that doesn't mean you are stupid. I don't think calling someone stupid is OK. You just have terrible taste and judgment and probably only give 40% effort at everything.These sound clear and crisp. Bass response is good without being overbearing. (for those who really like heavy bass, that has nothing to do with bears).Sound is great. Really great. Way better than those earbuds you've been using that start to feel uncomfortable after 45 minutes. Go on, take the plunge. I promise you will happy with your purchase and grateful to me and then we can be friends. You will love these headphones. Later, you will learn to love me.I can tell you are losing interest. I know that look. I'll wrap this up. Buy these headphones. You won't be disappointed. Get a cheap hard case. I found one on Amazon for around $9. Now you have noise cancelling g headphones that sound great, fit great, last a very long time on a single charge, and you'll invest way under $100 all in. You will be the envy of your friends. Or at least your friends' ears.",09/26/2020,AHIKDM2QQWVUXH6ZZKNTI52QJ2DA,1,42,Color: Black

As soon as the bass hits, the headphones start thumping and vibrating. My ears fit comfortably in the cups and I can hear the ANC working without music playing. It could be a bit more but it works. It is like I am in a different zone. The max volume could be higher. I preferred a USB-C port but will settle with this because of the purported 40-hour or 60-hour battery life. I recommend this to anyone on a budget who wants something that will last long.

I spent a good amount of time researching and the reviews convinced me to try these. I use them every day at the gym. The sound is comparable to Beats Studio, which is what I used for the last 3 years until they finally started to fall apart. I guess I’m rough on headphones between the sweat from the gym and careless handling. I consider these one of my better purchases. They always connect easily, the sound is very high quality, and the battery life is phenomenal. I spend 2 hours per day at the gym and I charge them once weekly, but they would last longer if I waited. I’ve been very happy with everything about these headphones. This is that rare time in life when buying the less expensive option actually works out well. If you’re comparing these to something in the $250 range, just get these. You’ll be glad you did.

I've been using the Skullcandy brand for years and spent close to $100 on those and they are not comfortable after an hour or so. The headband weighs down on your head and the cushion makes them sit heavily on your head. Just not comfortable long term. These are light and comfortable with cushion ear cups that feel nice on your ears. As for what I'm not fond of, it seems like it takes a while to turn off when I push the power button. The noise canceling is okay and isn't up to some other higher end brands, but it's not bad. I love the extended playtime but wish the charging cord was longer and a USB C configuration, so I don't have to swap around cords for this and other devices. Still a great value and sounds good with EDM to acoustic music. Base levels are rich and treble doesn't sound tinny. Nice rich sound for a reasonable price. Would buy again.

955,RKHKXMSIWHYZW,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect, and better than the newer versions",Amazon Customer,4,"TL;DR -- these are the best noise canceling headphones, and they perform at or above the level of more expensive headphones. I tried the newer Q30 version and switched back to these Q20s due to the better performance.I bought these about a year ago, and I've loved them. The noise cancellation is excellent--my sister was showing me the noise cancellation on her new AirPods Max and it was comparable these Q20s. I get easily overwhelmed by lots of noise, so the noise canceling feature was the most important to me when selecting headphones. I use these to block out my husband watching TV, dogs barking, neighbors blasting music in my apartment building, people talking loudly on airplanes, etc. They are excellent, and I can wear them for several hours before my ears start to get a little sore. The battery life on the headphones is also really good. I'm not a huge audiophile so I can't really tell you if the sound quality is as good as more expensive headphones, but I have no complaints about the sound when I'm listening to music.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that I can only connect to one device at a time. If I'm using them for my laptop and I get a call on my phone, I can't take the call on my headset without manually switching the bluetooth connection over. This bothered me enough to try the newer Q30 headphones, which can connect to two devices simultaneously and also have a little feature that switches from noise cancellation mode to transparency mode when you tap the right earphone. After a couple weeks of trying them out, I am returning the Q30s and going back to my Q20s. The newer headphones had less effective noise cancellation, and I would occasionally get a sharp piercing sound in my ear through the headphones that was a little painful. Some of this could be the shape of my ears or whatever, but I found the Q20s to be more comfortable with better noise cancellation, and a much better price point. I can live with the minor inconvenience of the single bluetooth connection in exchange for better noise cancelation.",04/12/2024,AEYVMYSZVTBHXNPGVOTMJ5G3JRTQ,1,88,Color: Blue

You know the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" or if you want quality you have to pay for it. Not the case with these what makes them even better was they're on sale for $40. I'm so amazed at the sound and quality from them.I haven't even spoke about the phone call quality. My car is modified with a loud exhaust and stiff motor mounts which makes you feel the vibrations from the motor and makes the car loud inside the cab. None of my previous headsets, ear buds or fm transmitter could anyone hear me on phone calls everyone said my car was to noisy. Used these the first time the other day when my wife called, she said I sounded clear and she could barely hear my car, the audio on my end was even better so again I can't stress enough how awesome these headset are.

963,R1FHD65JDCCMGU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars O.M.G. (for the price),Giblet Gravey,5,"Just got these, but had to say they really sound AWESOME! These provide the best sound I've ever heard via streaming Apple music, and that is compared with my Audio-Technica hard-wired M50s and my Beats Studio Buds (and some cheaper headphones/ear-buds). I'm also comparing this with a good $200 DAC and high-end Bluetooth loudspeakers (or again the M50s).With default settings (ANC on, no EQ) there was a noise-floor and too much bass. The ANC defaults to on, so the first thing I do is turn that OFF (...every time I turn-on the headphones...). I have no use for ANC, and find any ANC does ""funny things"" to my ears, even ignoring the noise-floor.Next, I'm using Apple music, lossless, so my source material is good. Then, I use Boom 3D and my Android phone. I use Boom 3D pretty much everywhere, since I often like compression for those podcasts or movies with volume ""all over the place"", but that's just Windows. Here, with these headphones on Android, Boom 3D is limited to the basic functions (EQ, and a bit of DSP effects). Anyway, after using Boom 3D's EQ to dial-down the bass (BTW, the bass-boost on the headphones is INSANE: not for me, and BTW I'm a bass-player), I was SHOCKED how good these headphones sounded!S H O C K E D !Hey, they are still $60 headphones (not the strongest build-quality, ANC has to be turned-off every time), but for the price (...and I got them on sale...), I am VERY happy.I realize not everyone uses Boom 3D (worth a try, BTW), but I do suggest having some EQ handy to dial-down the bass, or otherwise tune these to your preferences.

Sound is great I don’t have much comparison to other tho. However, I have tried the beats and this are definitely lightweight which is something I was looking forward since I always get headaches specially if putting stuff in my head. So far when I used them for a couple hours it hasn’t happened tho be aware I think the most amount I used them have been 4 hours maybe. I used them when I’m cooking or cleaning too since the duration of the battery is so long which is a plus. For music and audiobooks are great. If you want something cheaper I’ll go for this ones.

At first I put the headphones on and played some hip hop to see how the depth of bass and crispness of the mids and highs are and I thought it sounded GREAT... but wasn't blown away. These are not expensive so it was exactly what I thought it would be BUT..... I finally read the manual and there's a button you click 2 times. I clicked it 2 times and IMMEDIATELY smiled. The clear deep bass coming from this little headset is amazing! Even at 100% volume up, its crystal clear and absolutely no distortion at all. I feel like I have a pair or JBLs or Beats on. It's a no brainer on buying these. I'm going to order 3 more for my kids. They tried them on and they LOVE them. They always lose the little expensive earbuds. Can't lose these. The only thing I would wish better would be... the placement of buttons. When you fold them up, the power button on the left ear touches the right ear and turns on every time! If you don't notice this, it will be constantly on. Even so, it really won't matter because they must have alien technology because the battery life on these mamajammaz are absolutely insane. I charged mine when I first got them and used them alot. All day long many days and when I check the power it says...""Battery high"". STILL!!

I am happy with this purchase.However, there are two things that I don't like about this headphone that could've been very very easy to fix:The off button is moody - almost every time, i have to double check that it actually turned off the headphones, because many times, pressing & holding it for 3 seconds (like the manual says) does absolutely nothing.Second, the USB port is USB Micro, rather than USB C. This is the only new device I bought in the last few years that uses USB Micro, and whenever I need to charge it I need to scramble for my one usb mini cable. While USB C I have everywhere, since that's the standard.Sound-wise, the headphones deliver pleasantly colored sound - these are not studio monitors, they prettify what you hear, and for me that's a good thing. The noise cancellation is soft, if that's the most important feature for you, look elsewhere. For me it's ok, reduces ambient noise but doesn't feel like a vacuum.Overall, 3 stars generally and 1 additional star for the great price.",05/5/2024,AHLUTP5Z23FAXPIWTWVMJF7ZJZEA,1,10,Color: Black

The only downfall that I found, is if I'm working around the house and I have my head tilt down for a period of time, they do slip off a little bit.",06/30/2024,AGF3CQMZNHI4VRZ5CQSGYHZR4XIA,1,0,Color: Black
975,R28XB0YE3AL2H,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Love these headphones,Alyssa Cox,5,"I have really enjoyed these headphones - they fit over the ear pretty well. They don't stay on the head too great when bending over or moving too quickly. The sound is great, the noise cancelling isn't very good, but it's better than nothing. The bass sounds good in it too. The ear muff part does eventually cause sweat and discomfort on the head with prolonged wear. But I would purchase these again!",06/17/2024,AHM7WRXZBJUUVLEBH6RGCOKKJ7SA,1,0,Color: Black
976,R2401JJ4DH7O46,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Find,Smearachain,4,"I needed headphones to block very unwanted background ""noise"" at the gym and my office. These headphones are working near perfectly. The sound quality is much better that expected. They block just enough noise and others music. They fit quite good with one exception - I wish they could be snugger. When I lay on a weight bench or bend over for specific exercises, they start to slide forward/back. Given the quality of the sound and cancellation I can live with this. And considering the price which is perfect.Note about every 10 minutes the music momentarily stops (1 second). I don't care about that.Very good buy.Update 17 June - the fit has significantly loosened to the point they start sliding off when I look up or down. The battery power has been great until 5 days ago. They went from 100% to 80% after a 1 hour workout - 13th. Then 60% the next day - 14th. This morning they were at 20%. Haven't used them since the 14th.",05/2/2024,AH4NO6DLGSMKPW4LOZ4KZDF524IA,1,1,Color: Black

Good sound quality, charges last a long time, easy to use, good connectivity, very comfortable. I have a large head (size 8) and wear glasses, which can be a bummer when it comes to headphones. No issues with these. The noise cancelling doesn’t completely mute the outside world—I can still hear the phone at work, which is perfect for me. They do a bit of the ear sucking thing that noise cancelling headphones sometimes do.",06/16/2024,AGGEWU743V3SINKPAXXYH6PO44RA,1,0,Color: Black

980,R329DZASNXFCSJ,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality,Bashie,5,I bought these on recommendation. I honestly wasn't expecting them to sound as good as they do. I have a large commercial zero turn mower(40hp). The headphones cut the mower sound down to around 20 decibels. Bluetoothed music has a rich full sound. These are a steal when compared to the big name brand noise reducing headphones. Nobody would be disappointed with the sound quality. Especially at this price range.,06/16/2024,AECQ2IQPEOOMS2ZWLZOS6FKRC5VQ,1,0,Color: Blue

My go-to headphones, wired, were Sony Studio Monitor headphones, MDR-V6, and these headphones I think are better, and are cheaper. Over the years I've had Bose sound systems of various kinds, at times with a 10-inch down-firing Klipsch subwoofer driven by Onkyo amp/receivers--I like good sound systems. I recommend these headphones wholeheartedly.",06/21/2024,AHFSLGVXFQOXNVBDWLLPVT5ARFYQ,1,0,Color: Black

The seller reached out to me and offered me a few solutions to fix the problem with the headphones. I appreciated that they took the time to resolve the issue. In the end, we determined that the particular headphones received were faulty. The seller graciously sent new replacement headphones. I'm happy to report they are working great and the quality of sound is really good.The seller is top notch when it comes to customer service.

I've accidentally left them on all day and still didn't need to charge them for another few weeks. I generally use them at least a little bit everyday and I can't remember the last time I charged them. They sound great and the noise cancelling is pretty good. If you don't mind pretty big headphones these are a really good buy.,06/30/2024,AHK2WUTCODFAG4OGFFOX6DHGXBGA,1,0,Color: Black
984,R3RD7IRXSIB4D,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good deal. Pleasantly surprised with the sound quality!,Joe DeMille,4,"Got this on sale around $40 about two weeks ago. Way better than other headphones I have tried in the same price range $40-60. This is my third set of Soundcore products. I have been pretty happy with each of them, which is why I was comfortable going a bit beyond my initial budget.The noise canceling works great and has the option of being turned off. It's amazing to feel the sense of silence that the active noise canceling creates. Great for sensory processing, even when using this feature without music or a movie.The on/off/connected sounds and voice are pleasant and the volume for these can be adjusted independent of the headset volume. No loud annoying voice breaking my ear drum to let me know it's on, or the battery is low.Sound is crisp and clear with good mid tones and bass. I have only used these for watching movies so far but they seem to have a good range and I can actually hear background noises in films that I hadn't been able to pick up on before. The listening experience is pleasant and encompassing.I took one phone call so far and I could hear the other person well. They seemed to hear me fine. I did not ask for their feedback so I'm unsure of the sound quality in that regard.The control buttons are easy to understand and use and the headset itself is adjustable and comfortable. I do have a small head so every full headset like this is always just a fraction too large, but with this set it doesn't hurt my head or ears. I have piercings and the soft ear cups do not irritate them.Only downside is that the charging port is for a micro-usb, but that is just a minor inconvenience.So far the charge lasts me a few days with some pretty heavy use, including leaving them on when I pause a show and get caught up doing something else.Easy to connect via Bluetooth. I have not tried these line-in yet.Good purchase, even at normal price. I usually put a lot of effort researching different products to find affordable items that are still good quality. I'm glad I went with this headset as it surpassed my expectations.",12/24/2023,AGKIKMUDFTERLAHVMUUZUMBD3JNQ,1,2,Color: Black

But for sound quality and price? Can’t be beat. Just wish they could update that charger.Also, the app requires you to pair your device to use and it can’t find my headset when I have it in pair mode with the app. Minor headaches but they sound good out of the box.",05/6/2024,AGECM6JTELN47SCCNQMNYICJUBRQ,1,0,Color: Black

987,R1R951OWKYVL3Y,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for the money... so far.,Delmore,4,"The headphones were inexpensive compared to some of the other options. My main gripe is that the instruction manual that came with it is printed in a microscopic typeface in LIGHT BLUE ink, rendering it impossible to read without a magnifying glass and a strong light. I found a more readable version on the product's website, but it was confusingly written. I managed to figure it out finally, but what's wrong with having a simple diagram that points to and identifies each of the three buttons on the headphones. It's also difficult to see the black on black buttons. Letters and markings are etched or pressed into the plastic. How hard would it be to apply a bit of white or red paint so that the functions are easier to see? I even need a flashlight to determine which side is L and which is R. Yeah, I'm a grumpy old man with poor eyesight.On the plus side: the noise canceling feature works well and they sound good and they were way cheap compared to Bose for example.",03/9/2024,AGMEYNEPX6CZRP2AH6OIOU2A7WLA,1,0,Color: Black

Initially, I was worried they wouldn't get loud enough, but I soon realized this was actually a good thing. Many people, both young and old, suffer from hearing loss without realizing it, as hearing loss itself is painless.

994,R32JVWLNA6ETSJ,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable bang-for-buck,JK,4,"I grabbed these while on a trip; I have an old pair of Sony XM3 noise cancelling headphones I normally use on the plane, but since my wife was using them for her own trip, it left me needing something for the 5 hour flight. Grabbed these since the price was right and I could get them from Amazon overnight.I wasn't expecting them to be as good as my Sonys, but they did surprise me, ESPECIALLY at their price point. These things punch well above their price.-Noise Cancelling: not as good as the XM3s, but enough to dull the engine roar and passenger chatter, which was all I was expecting. 4 stars here, as I'm not sure you'd get a better ANC experience without spending 3x as much.-Sound Quality: very impressed, for the price. A little muddy in the mids/highs, but these aren't audiophile headphones. Bass was fantastic (regardless of price).-Comfort/Build: on the cheap side (but they're under $50, so well within expectations). 5 hours on the plane with no issues, plenty of battery life remaining. I wear a 7 5/8 hat, so I struggle finding headphones that don't squeeze my melon - these were completely fine.If you have $50 and need some decent BT headphones, get these. Don't buy them specifically for the ANC, but it's a nice bonus to have at this price point. Fantastic general-use/flight headphones, and I'll be keeping them as spares for flights.",02/14/2024,AHP7OAQSTTGHTRO6TZU7WVTAFB4A,1,2,Color: Black
